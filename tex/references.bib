  abstract = {Theory predicts that intraspecific competition should be stronger than interspecific competition for any pair of stably coexisting species, yet previous literature reviews found little support for this pattern. We screened over 5400 publications and identified 39 studies that quantified phenomenological intraspecific and interspecific interactions in terrestrial plant communities. Of the 67\% of species pairs in which both intra- and interspecific effects were negative (competitive), intraspecific competition was, on average, four to five-fold stronger than interspecific competition. Of the remaining pairs, 93\% featured intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation, a situation that stabilises coexistence. The difference between intra- and interspecific effects tended to be larger in observational than experimental data sets, in field than greenhouse studies, and in studies that quantified population growth over the full life cycle rather than single fitness components. Our results imply that processes promoting stable coexistence at local scales are common and consequential across terrestrial plant communities.},

  abstract = {Ecologists now recognize that controversy over the relative importance of niches and neutrality cannot be resolved by analyzing species abundance patterns. Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

  abstract = {Mark--recapture studies generate biased, or distance-weighted, movement data because short distances are sampled more frequently than long distances. Using models and field data, we determined how study design affects distance weighting and the movement distributions of stream fishes. We first modeled distance weighting as a function of recapture section length in an unbranching stream. The addition of an unsampled tributary to one of these models substantially increased distance weighting by decreasing the percentage of upstream distances that were sampled. Similarly, the presence of multiple tributaries in the field study resulted in severe bias. However, increasing recapture section length strongly affected distance weighting in both the model and the field study, producing a zone where the number of fish moving could be estimated with little bias. Subsampled data from the field study indicated that longer median (three of three species) and maximum distances (two of three species) can be detected by increasing the length of the recapture section. The effect was extreme for bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, a highly mobile species, which exhibited a longer median distance (133 m versus 60 m), a longer maximum distance (1,144 m versus 708 m), and a distance distribution that differed in shape when the full (4,123-m recapture section) and subsampled (1,978-m recapture section) data sets were compared. Correction factors that adjust the observed number of movements to undersampled distances upwards and those to oversampled distances downwards could not mitigate the distance weighting imposed by the shorter recapture section. Future studies should identify the spatial scale over which movements can be accurately measured before data are collected. Increasing recapture section length a priori is far superior to using post hoc correction factors to reduce the influence of distance weighting on observed distributions. Implementing these strategies will be especially important in stream networks where fish can follow multiple pathways out of the recapture section.},

  abstract = {Identifying factors that influence fish movement is a key step in predicting how populations respond to environmental change. Using mark-recapture (four species) and trap capture (eight species) data, we examined relationships between three attributes of movement and 15 ecological variables. The probability of emigrating from a reach was positively related to intermittency (one species) and body size (one species) and negatively related to distance from the mainstem creek (two species) and habitat complexity (one species). The number of fish moving upstream through traps was positively related to increases in flow (five species), day length (three species), and water temperature (two species); the number moving through downstream traps was positively associated with increases in flow (three species). Distance moved was greater for fish moving through unsuitable reaches (one species). Floods have a pervasive effect on fish movement, and human activities that affect flows will have widespread implications. The importance of other factors varies interspecifically, which may translate into variation in persistence and colonization rates. For example, species that exhibit reach fidelity in complex habitats may increase movement if habitats are homogenized. These species may suffer population declines because of the cost of increased movement and may ultimately be replaced by ecological generalists. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The Fundulus notatus species complex includes several species with similar ecological niches that exhibit broadly overlapping ranges. We conducted a mark--recapture study on two of the most widely distributed members of this species complex to improve our understanding of their movement and habitat use. A population of F. notatus was studied between June and August of 2008 and 2009 in Cahokia Creek, a small tributary of the Mississippi River in Illinois, along with a parallel study of Fundulus olivaceus between May and July of 2009 in Big Creek, a tributary of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. Fish were recaptured approximately weekly, and habitat variables were measured. Estimated daily movement rates varied significantly both between locations and between years. Fundulus olivaceus in Big Creek moved {$<$}1 m per day, while F. notatus in Cahokia Creek in 2009 moved nearly 23 m per day. The distribution of movements was strongly leptokurtic in all three data sets. Differences in movement rates were attributed to significant differences in population size and habitat characteristics. Our data did not support the hypothesis that populations consist of distinct mobile and resident components. Instead, individual fish went through periods of little or no movement followed by extensive movement (consistent with the home range shift model of fish movement). We discuss the implications these results have for contact zone dynamics between these two species.},

  abstract = {1. Random dispersal leads to spatial coexistence via two mechanisms (emigration-mediated and source--sink), both of which involve the movement of organisms from areas of higher to lower fitness. What is not known is whether such coexistence would occur if organisms dispersed non-randomly, using cues such as density and habitat quality to gauge fitness differences between habitats. Here, I conduct a comparative analysis of random and non-random dispersal strategies in a foodweb with a basal resource, top predator, and two intermediate consumers that exhibit a trade-off between competitive ability and predator susceptibility. 2. I find a striking contrast between density- and habitat-dependent dispersal in their effects on spatial coexistence. Dispersal in response to competitor and predator density facilitates coexistence while dispersal in response to habitat quality (resource productivity and predator pressure) inhibits it. Moreover, density-dependent dispersal changes species' distribution patterns from interspecific segregation to interspecific aggregation, while habitat-dependent dispersal preserves the interspecific segregation observed in the absence of dispersal. Under density-dependent dispersal, widespread spatial coexistence results in an overall decline in the abundance of the inferior competitor that is less susceptible to predation and an overall increase in the abundance of the superior competitor that is more susceptible to predation. Under habitat-dependent dispersal, restricted spatial coexistence results in species' abundances being essentially unchanged from those observed in the absence of dispersal. 3. A key outcome is that when the superior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the inferior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is possible in both resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. However, when the inferior competitor moves in the direction of increasing fitness but the superior competitor does not, spatial coexistence is precluded in resource-poor habitats and greatly reduced in resource-rich habitats. This suggests that species-specific differences may play an important role in driving spatial coexistence patterns. 4. The comparative framework yields predictions that can be tested with experiments that manipulate the relative mobilities of interacting species, or observational data on relative abundances and distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {Interference competition is ubiquitous in nature. Yet its effects on resource exploitation remain largely unexplored for species that compete for dynamic resources. Here, I present a model of exploitative and interference competition with explicit resource dynamics. The model incorporates both biotic and abiotic resources. It considers interference competition both in the classical sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, and interference on, the other species) and in the broad sense (i.e. each species suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from, but can experience an increase in growth rate via interference on, the other species). Coexistence cannot occur under classical interference competition even when the species inferior at resource exploitation is superior at interference. Such a trade--off can, however, change the mechanism of competitive exclusion from dominance by the superior resource exploiter to a priority effect. Now the inferior resource exploiter can exclude the superior resource exploiter provided it has a higher initial abundance. By contrast, when interference is beneficial to the interacting species, coexistence is possible via a trade--off between exploitation and interference. These results hold regardless of whether the resource is biotic or abiotic, indicating that the outcome of exploitative and interference competition does not depend on the exact nature of resource dynamics. The model makes two key predictions. First, species that engage in costly interference mechanisms (e.g. territoriality, overgrowth or undercutting, allelopathy and other forms of chemical competition) should not be able to coexist unless they also engage in beneficial interference mechanisms (e.g. predation or parasitism). Second, exotic invasive species that displace native biota should be superior resource exploiters that have strong interference effects on native species with little or negative cost. The first prediction provides a potential explanation for patterns observed in several natural systems, including plants, aquatic invertebrates and insects. The second prediction is supported by data on invasive plants and vertebrates.},

  abstract = {I investigate the influence of dispersal strategies on intraguild prey and predators (competing species that prey on each other). I find an asymmetry between the intraguild prey and predator in their responses to each other's dispersal. The intraguild predator's dispersal strategy and dispersal behavior have strong effects on the intraguild prey's abundance pattern, but the intraguild prey's dispersal strategy and behavior have little or no effect on the intraguild predator's abundance pattern. This asymmetry arises from the different constraints faced by the two species: the intraguild prey has to acquire resources while avoiding predation, but the intraguild predator only has to acquire resources. It leads to puzzling distribution patterns: when the intraguild prey and predator both move away from areas of high density, they become aggregated to high-density habitats, but when they both move toward areas of high resource productivity, they become segregated to resource-poor and resource-rich habitats. Aggregation is more likely when dispersal is random or less optimal, and segregation is more likely as dispersal becomes more optimal. The crucial implication is that trophic constraints dictate the fitness benefits of using dispersal strategies to sample environmental heterogeneity. A strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild predator can lead to a more optimal outcome for both the intraguild predator and prey than a strategy that affords greater benefits to an intraguild prey.},

Thus, a neutral model reflecting random colonization and extinction dynamics may be sufficient to predict assemblage patterns at the scale of local habitat patches. If water level fluctuations and associated patch dynamics are sufficiently predictable, however, community assembly on habitat patches also may be influenced by species-specific responses to habitat features and/or species interactions. We experimentally manipulated structural complexity and proximity to source habitat (which influences colonization rate) of simulated rocky patches in the littoral zone of a tropical lowland river and demonstrate significant effects of both factors on species density of fishes and macroinvertebrates. Interspecific variation in vagility significantly affected assemblage response to habitat complexity. In a second experiment, created habitat patches were sampled over time intervals ranging from 1~day to 36~days to examine temporal dynamics of community assembly. A null-model test revealed that assemblage structure became increasingly non-random, concomitant with increasing species density, over time. Community dynamics in newly formed habitat patches appeared to be dominated by dispersal, whereas in older patches, abundances of individual species increasingly were influenced by habitat characteristics. These data suggest that species-specific responses to environmental variation resulted, in part, because of species interactions. We conclude that community assembly in shallow habitats of this tropical lowland river is influenced by physical habitat characteristics, the spatial distribution of habitat patches, and species interactions as habitats are saturated with individuals.},

These insights may support a greater empirical understanding of ecological resilience, and the application of resilience concepts toward ecosystem management. Distinct types of dynamics in natural communities can be used to interpret and apply resilience concepts, but quantitative methods that can systematically distinguish among them are needed. We develop a quantitative method to analyze long-term records of plant community dynamics using principles of movement ecology. We analyzed dissimilarity of species composition through time with linear and nonlinear statistical models to assign community change to four classes of movement trajectories. Compositional change in each sampled plot through time was classified into four classes, stability, abrupt nonlinear change, transient reversible change, and gradual linear drift, each representing a different aspect of ecological resilience. These competing models were evaluated based on estimated coefficients, goodness of fit, and parsimony. We tested our method's accuracy and robustness through simulations, or the ability to distinguish among trajectories and classify them correctly. We simulated 16,000 trajectories of four types, of which 94--100\% were correctly classified. Next, we analyzed 13 long-term vegetation records from North American grasslands (annual grasslands with warm-season and cool-season communities, shortgrass, mixedgrass, and tallgrass prairies, and sagebrush steppe), and a record of primary succession at Mt. St. Helens volcano. Collectively, we analyzed 14,647 observations from 775 plots, between 1915 and 2012. Dynamics could be reliably assigned for 705 plots (91\%), and overall statistical fit was high (goodness of fit, 0.77 {\textpm} 0.15 SD). Among the perennial grasslands, stability was most common (44\% of all plots), followed by gradual linear (22\%), abrupt nonlinear (17\%), and reversible (6\%) change. Among annual grasslands, abrupt nonlinear shifts (33\%) were more common in the warm-season community than in the cool-season (20\%). As expected, abrupt nonlinear change was common during primary succession (51\%) while reversible change was rare (3\%). Generally, reversible dynamics often required 2--3 decades. Analysis of long-term community change, or trajectories, with principles of movement ecology provides a quantitative basis to compare and interpret ecological resilience within and among ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Connectivity is classically considered an emergent property of landscapes encapsulating individuals' flows across space. However, its operational use requires a precise understanding of why and how organisms disperse. Such movements, and hence landscape connectivity, will obviously vary according to both organism properties and landscape features. We review whether landscape connectivity estimates could gain in both precision and generality by incorporating three fundamental outcomes of dispersal theory. Firstly, dispersal is a multi-causal process; its restriction to an `escape reaction' to environmental unsuitability is an oversimplification, as dispersing individuals can leave excellent quality habitat patches or stay in poor-quality habitats according to the relative costs and benefits of dispersal and philopatry. Secondly, species, populations and individuals do not always react similarly to those cues that trigger dispersal, which sometimes results in contrasting dispersal strategies. Finally, dispersal is a major component of fitness and is thus under strong selective pressures, which could generate rapid adaptations of dispersal strategies. Such evolutionary responses will entail spatiotemporal variation in landscape connectivity. We thus strongly recommend the use of genetic tools to: (i) assess gene flow intensity and direction among populations in a given landscape; and (ii) accurately estimate landscape features impacting gene flow, and hence landscape connectivity. Such approaches will provide the basic data for planning corridors or stepping stones aiming at (re)connecting local populations of a given species in a given landscape. This strategy is clearly species- and landscape-specific. But we suggest that the ecological network in a given landscape could be designed by stacking up such linkages designed for several species living in different ecosystems. This procedure relies on the use of umbrella species that are representative of other species living in the same ecosystem.},

Our goal is for both theoretical and empirical ecologists to be able to use the theory to interpret their findings, and to get a precise sense of the limits of its applicability. To this end, we introduce an explicit handling of limiting factors, and a new way of defining the scaling factors that partition invasion growth rates into the different mechanisms contributing to coexistence. We explain terminology such as relative nonlinearity, storage effect, and growth-density covariance, both in a formal setting and through their biological interpretation. We review the theory's applications and contributions to our current understanding of species coexistence. While the theory is very general, it is not well suited to all problems, so we carefully point out its limitations. Finally, we critique the paradigm of decomposing invasion growth rates into stabilizing and equalizing components: we argue that these concepts are useful when used judiciously, but have often been employed in an overly simplified way to justify false claims.},

  abstract = {For two competing species, intraspecific competition must exceed interspecific competition for coexistence. To generalize this well-known criterion to multiple competing species, one must take into account both the distribution of interaction strengths and community structure. Here we derive a multispecies generalization of the two-species rule in the context of symmetric Lotka-Volterra competition and obtain explicit stability conditions for random competitive communities. We then explore the influence of community structure on coexistence. Results show that both the most and least stabilized cases have striking global structures, with a nested pattern emerging in both cases. The distribution of intraspecific coefficients leading to the most and least stabilized communities also follows a predictable pattern that can be justified analytically. In addition, we show that the size of the parameter space allowing for feasible communities always increases with the strength of intraspecific effects in a characteristic way that is independent of the interspecific interaction structure. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of our results to nonsymmetric competition.},

Creek chubs were highly associated with patches of cover consisting of wood or macrophytes. Movements among 37 patches in a 1.1-km segment were assessed in a mark-recapture study. Over 2-week intervals, 44\% of recaptured fish changed patches. Net distances moved ranged from 4 to 606 m, median distance moved was 49 m. Of fish recaptured repeatedly during the four sampling periods, most (65\%) changed patches at least once, but few were consistently mobile. Inter-patch distance was an important variable with a negative effect on creek chub movements. Inter-patch cover was less important, but had a positive effect on movements. Frequent, short-distance movements among habitat patches in summer are a component of the ecology of creek chubs and the spatial arrangement of patches, and intervening stream conditions appear to mediate those movements.},

The isotopic composition of carbon sources and fish varied significantly among the studied environments. The autochthonous resources, represented by the phytoplankton, were the most assimilated by the species, followed by periphyton and sediment microbial biomass. The species used the sources differently in each environment. This study suggests that the inherent characteristics of this area, as well as the size of the watershed, the dry season, anthropogenic actions, and phytoplankton productivity, favor the use of autochthonous resources by the species studied. Therefore, studies in the floodplain should employ an eco-hydrological approach that quantifies the magnitude of energy subsidies, as well as an access route to consumers, knowledge about the selectivity of detritivorous species and the effects of different land uses.Keywords:Aquatic ecosystems; Carbon sources; Fish; Organic matter; Stable isotopes},

Despite the importance of species interactions in determining fitness, a quantitative synthesis of how they affect dispersal is lacking. We present a meta-analysis asking (i) whether the interaction experienced and/or perceived by a focal species (detrimental interaction with predators, competitors, parasites or beneficial interaction with resources, hosts, mutualists) affects its dispersal; and (ii) how the species' ecological and biological background affects the direction and strength of this interaction-dependent dispersal. After a systematic search focusing on actively dispersing species, we extracted 397 effect sizes from 118 empirical studies encompassing 221 species pairs; arthropods were best represented, followed by vertebrates, protists and others. Detrimental species interactions increased the focal species' dispersal (adjusted effect: 0.33 [0.06, 0.60]), while beneficial interactions decreased it (-0.55 [-0.92, -0.17]). The effect depended on the dispersal phase, with detrimental interactors having opposite impacts on emigration and transience. Interaction-dependent dispersal was negatively related to species' interaction strength, and depended on the global community composition, with cues of presence having stronger effects than the presence of the interactor and the ecological complexity of the community. Our work demonstrates the importance of interspecific interactions on dispersal plasticity, with consequences for metacommunity dynamics.

  abstract = {Cold-water corals (CWC) can form complex three-dimensional structures that can support a diverse macro- and megafaunal community. These reef structures provide important biogenic habitats that can act as refuge, feeding, spawning and nursery areas for fish. However, quantitative data assessing the linkage between CWC and fish are scarce. The North Atlantic Ocean is a key region in the worldwide distribution of Lophelia pertusa, which is thought to be the most widespread frame-work forming cold-water coral species in the world. This study examined the relationship between fish and CWC reefs in the northeast Atlantic Ocean by means of video and remotely sensed data from three different CWC communities (Rockall Bank, Hatton Bank and the Belgica Mound Province). Using a tethered camera system, 37 transects were recorded during a period of 8 years. Fish--coral association was investigated using a generalised linear modelling (GLM) approach. Overall, Lepidion eques was the most abundant fish species present (143ind.ha-1). Other common species were Sigmops bathyphilus (17ind.ha-1), Synaphobranchus kaupii (15ind.ha-1), Helicolenus dactylopterus (16ind.ha-1) and Mora moro (7ind.ha-1). The highest fish biomass was measured for Lophius piscatorius (26.3kgha-1). Other species with a high biomass were Helicolenus dactylopterus (4.3kgha-1), Lepidion eques (13.2kgha-1) and Mora moro (7.8kgha-1). Overall, no significant difference in fish abundance and biomass was found at coral framework habitats compared to non-coral areas. The relationship between fish and coral framework varied among fish species and study site. Fish count and length modelling results showed that terrain variables explain a small proportion of the variation of our data. Depth, coral-framework and terrain rugosity were generally the most important explanatory variables, but this varied with species and study site.},

Walleye mercury concentrations exceeded 0.22~ppm --- a threshold triggering more restrictive human consumption advisories for sensitive populations --- at a 23~\% smaller size, and average-sized walleye (420~mm) exceeded this threshold at a rate of 77~\% in invaded lakes, compared to 35~\% in uninvaded lakes.

In the southwestern United States, decades of water diversion, construction of large impoundments, and loss of floodplain habitats have all contributed to highly fragmented riverscapes. A capture--translocation strategy was implemented for Razorback Suckers Xyrauchen texanus in the San Juan River to mitigate the negative effects of two barriers while precluding the upstream movement of nonnative species. We hypothesized that translocated individuals would remain upstream of barriers during the spawning season and that aggregations of translocated Razorback Suckers would be identified upstream in spawning habitats. Methods We used radiotelemetry to assess movement of Razorback Suckers after translocation above the two barriers. We deployed fixed remote radio receivers to determine residency time above each barrier and conducted mobile telemetry surveys to monitor upstream destinations after translocation. Result Although most Razorback Suckers returned downstream of barriers within 2 months of translocation, we provide evidence that most individuals remained upstream long enough to successfully spawn. After translocation above the Piute Farms Waterfall, 80\% of individuals remained upstream for 26 days in 2020 and for 23 days in 2021. Further upstream (307 km), at a weir operated by the Public Service Company of New Mexico, 80\% of translocated individuals remained above the barrier for 37 days in 2021 and for 25 days in 2022. After fish translocation above both barriers, we observed upstream movements ranging from 2 to 262 km and we detected distinct aggregations within the expected spawning season. Conclusion Although translocation efforts seasonally reconnect migratory routes for a proportion of the population and may increase spawning potential, other conservation actions are likely still needed to improve recruitment conditions for juvenile fish.},

Activity costs among populations ranged from 0 to 40\% of the perch bioenergetics budget. We further evaluated the influence of activity rates on the food consumption estimates predicted by the Kitchell et al. model and the model proposed by Kerr (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 39: 371--379). As suggested by Kerr, activity costs increased as food consumption increased. However, we found no significant relationship between predicted and observed food consumption estimates for either model. The magnitude of, and the among-population variance in, the quantity of energy allocated to activity is consistent with our hypothesis that this component of the bioenergetics budget of fishes has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the explanation of inter-population differences in perch growth and, by extension, to the variance in growth of other actively foraging fish species.},

This balance shifts when a species from a competitive environment invades a depauperate habitat where interspecific competition is reduced. The resulting ecological release permits population niche expansion, via increased individual niche widths and/or increased among-individual variation. We report an experimental test of the theory of ecological release in three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We factorially manipulated the presence or absence of two interspecific competitors: juvenile cut-throat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) and prickly sculpin (Cottus asper). Consistent with the classic niche variation hypothesis, release from trout competition increased stickleback population niche width via increased among-individual variation, while individual niche widths remained unchanged. In contrast, release from sculpin competition had no effect on population niche width, because increased individual niche widths were offset by decreased between-individual variation. Our results confirm that ecological release from interspecific competition can lead to increases in niche width, and that these changes can occur on behavioural time scales. Importantly, we find that changes in population niche width are decoupled from changes in the niche widths of individuals within the population.},

  abstract = {Over the last three decades, passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags have been widely used to study fish populations. Interpretation of PIT tag detections, however, can be confounded by the presence of ghost tags, tags liberated when a fish dies. We used a combination of mobile antenna surveys, stationary antenna detections, and multistate mark--recapture modeling to assess the abundance and fate of ghost tags in a coastal California watershed. Accumulation of ghost tags from released hatchery-origin coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolts was substantial during California's recent drought, with 2224 ghost tags identified during mobile reader surveys. Between surveys, PIT tags moved downstream a median distance of 346 m and a maximum distance of 1982 m. Stationary antenna array detections indicated that these movements occurred during high-flow events, concurrent with live fish movement. The multistate model estimated that, during winter, approximately 40\% of tags were buried in the substrate beyond the read range of mobile readers. Failure to account for transport and burial dynamics of ghost tags can lead to biased estimates of fish abundance, survival, and movement. (English)},

  abstract = {Dispersal costs can be classified into energetic, time, risk and opportunity costs and may be levied directly or deferred during departure, transfer and settlement. They may equally be incurred during life stages before the actual dispersal event through investments in special morphologies. Because costs will eventually determine the performance of dispersing individuals and the evolution of dispersal, we here provide an extensive review on the different cost types that occur during dispersal in a wide array of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. In general, costs of transfer have been more widely documented in actively dispersing organisms, in contrast to a greater focus on costs during departure and settlement in plants and animals with a passive transfer phase. Costs related to the development of specific dispersal attributes appear to be much more prominent than previously accepted. Because costs induce trade-offs, they give rise to covariation between dispersal and other life-history traits at different scales of organismal organisation. The consequences of (i) the presence and magnitude of different costs during different phases of the dispersal process, and (ii) their internal organisation through covariation with other life-history traits, are synthesised with respect to potential consequences for species conservation and the need for development of a new generation of spatial simulation models.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is essential for population persistence in transient environments. While costs of dispersal are ubiquitous, individual advantages of dispersal remain poorly understood. Not all individuals from a population disperse, and individual heterogeneity in costs and benefits of dispersal underlie phenotype-dependent dispersal strategies. Dispersing phenotypes are always expected to maximize their fitness by adaptive decision making relative to the alternative strategy of remaining philopatric. While this first principle is well acknowledged in theoretical ecology, empirical verification is extremely difficult, due to a plethora of experimental constraints. We studied fitness prospects of dispersal in a game theoretical context using the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. We demonstrate that dispersing phenotypes represent those individuals able to maximize their fitness in a novel, less populated environment reached after dispersal. In contrast to philopatric phenotypes, successful dispersers performed better in a low density post-dispersal context, but worse in a high density philopatric context. They increased fitness about 450\% relative to the strategy of remaining philopatric. The optimization of phenotype-dependent dispersal, thus, maximizes fitness.},

  abstract = {Dispersal plays a pivotal role in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of spatially structured populations, communities and ecosystems. As an individual-based trait, dispersal is subject to both plasticity and evolution. Its dependence on conditions and context is well understood within single-species metapopulations. However, species do not exist in isolation; they interact locally through various horizontal and vertical interactions. While the significance of species interactions is recognized for species coexistence and food web functioning, our understanding of their influence on regional dynamics, such as their impact on spatial dynamics in metacommunities and meta-food webs, remains limited. Building upon insights from behavioural and community ecology, we aim to elucidate biodiversity as both a driver and an outcome of connectivity. By synthesizing conceptual, theoretical and empirical contributions from global experts in the field, we seek to explore how a more mechanistic understanding of diversity--dispersal relationships influences the distribution of species in spatially and temporally changing environments. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering interspecific interactions as drivers of dispersal, thus reshaping our understanding of fundamental dynamics including species coexistence and the emergent dynamics of metacommunities and meta-ecosystems. We envision that this initiative will pave the way for advanced forecasting approaches to understanding biodiversity dynamics under the pressures of global change.

As a result, all food web models require some unavoidable simplifications because of limited data availability, whether temporally, spatially, or taxonomically. Large databases of published trophic interactions have made this process somewhat easier, but knowledge gaps persist. We combine the use of databases with extensive field surveys, including gut-content analysis, to generate a food web for Lake George, NY. Including aquatic plants, phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish, our analysis identified 279 genera in the lake involved in 1910 interactions. After removing genera with no identified interactions or improbable interactions and grouping some genera into higher categories, the food web included 49 nodes with 484 interactions among them. The network structure of the inferred Lake George food web exhibits several common patterns such as relatively few trophic levels and the prevalence of tritrophic chains. Our results suggest that constructing food webs from databases provides a useful first step to determine topology. However, in situ sampling allowed us to account for additional interactions, as only 50 of the 106 directly observed interactions between fish and their prey were also found in published databases. Finally, we highlight the need to focus on developing a better understanding of herbivory in lakes, as species interactions among the diverse plankton and macroinvertebrate populations are not well known.},

However, we still have a limited knowledge on their relative importance to explain patterns of diversity across latitudinal gradients (LDG). Here, we investigate the extent to which these ecological mechanisms contribute to the LDG of reef fishes. Location Eastern Atlantic Ocean. Taxon Reef-associated ray-finned fishes. Methods We combined abundance data across 60{$^\circ$} of latitude with functional trait data and phylogenetic trees. A null model approach was used to decouple the influence of taxonomic diversity (TD) on functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) diversity. Standardized effect sizes (SES FD and SES PD) were used to explore patterns of overdispersion, clustering and randomness. Information theoretic approaches were used to investigate the role of large- (temperature, geographic isolation, nitrate and net primary productivity) and local-scale (human population and depth) drivers. We further assessed the role of demographic stochasticity and its interaction with species trophic identity and dispersal capacity. Results Taxonomic diversity peaked at 15{$^\circ$}--20{$^\circ$}N, with a second mode of lower magnitude at 45{$^\circ$}N; a pattern that was predicted by temperature, geographic isolation and productivity. Tropical regions displayed a higher proportion of overdispersed assemblages, whilst clustering increased towards temperate regions. Phylogenetic and functional overdispersion were associated with warmer, productive and isolated regions. Demographic stochasticity also contributed largely to community assembly, independently of ecoregions, although variation was dependent on the trophic identity and body size of species. Main conclusions Niche-based processes linking thermal and resource constraints to local coexistence mechanisms have contributed to the LDG in reef fishes. These processes do not act in isolation, stressing the importance of understanding interactions between deterministic and stochastic factors driving community structure in the face of rapid biodiversity change.},

This allows CNN-SDMs to perform better than classical SDMs in abundance prediction, with average gains of 10\%. These gains are stemming from enhanced abundance predictions for rare species and where widespread species are locally rare.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary causes of dispersal can be crucial in understanding the behaviour of spatially structured populations, and predicting how species respond to environmental change. Despite the focus of much theoretical research, simplistic assumptions regarding the dispersal process are still made. Dispersal is usually regarded as an unconditional process although in many cases fitness gains of dispersal are dependent on environmental factors and individual state. Condition-dependent dispersal strategies will often be superior to unconditional, fixed strategies. In addition, dispersal is often collapsed into a single parameter, despite it being a process composed of three interdependent stages: emigration, inter-patch movement and immigration, each of which may display different condition dependencies. Empirical studies have investigated correlates of these stages, emigration in particular, providing evidence for the prevalence of conditional dispersal strategies. Ill-defined use of the term `dispersal', for movement across many different spatial scales, further hinders making general conclusions and relating movement correlates to consequences at the population level. Logistical difficulties preclude a detailed study of dispersal for many species, however incorporating unrealistic dispersal assumptions in spatial population models may yield inaccurate and costly predictions. Further studies are necessary to explore the importance of incorporating specific condition-dependent dispersal strategies for evolutionary and population dynamic predictions.},

Great Plains streams have a depauperate and tolerant ichthyofauna and highly variable physicochemical conditions that may mask the effects of non-point-source pollution and stream habitat degradation. We developed an IBI based on fish assemblages by screening metrics for range, responsiveness to human influence, precision, and lack of redundancy; we then tested the IBI's ability to detect anthropogenic effects by validating the index with an independent data set. The IBI was composed of 10 metrics based on species richness and composition, trophic and reproductive guilds, and age structure. These 10 metrics had many significant correlations with substrate and water chemistry variables but had fewer significant correlations with riparian condition and watershed variables. Of the watershed variables, road density had the highest number of significant correlations with final IBI metrics. The IBI was validated by demonstrating its responsiveness to aggregate measures of human influence, site-level habitat, and water chemistry, and its lack of responsiveness to factors that varied naturally, such as stream size and site elevation. The IBI was also temporally stable within and between years during repeat visits to a subset of sampled reaches. This IBI can be used as a measure of biological integrity for management of prairie streams faced with threats such as introduced species, intensive agriculture, grazing, and coalbed natural gas extraction. Although we developed this IBI based on data from Montana prairie streams only, our IBI can probably serve as a framework for other North American plains streams and our results suggest that the IBI approach may be useful in other semiarid regions of the world.},

  abstract = {Invasive species can cause substantial ecological impacts on native biodiversity. While ecological theory attempts to explain the processes involved in the trophic integration of invaders into native food webs and their competitive impacts on resident species, results are equivocal. In addition, quantifying the relative strength of impacts from non-native species (interspecific competition) versus the release of native conspecifics (intraspecific competition) is important but rarely completed. Two model non-native fishes, the globally invasive Cyprinus carpio and Carassius auratus, and the model native fish Tinca tinca, were used in a pond experiment to test how increased intra- and interspecific competition influenced trophic niches and somatic growth rates. This was complemented by samples collected from three natural fish communities where the model fishes were present. The isotopic niche, calculated using stable isotope data, represented the trophic niche. The pond experiment used additive and substitutive treatments to quantify the trophic niche variation that resulted from intra- and interspecific competitive interactions. Although the trophic niche sizes of the model species were not significantly altered by any competitive treatment, they all resulted in patterns of interspecific niche divergence. Increased interspecific competition caused the trophic niche of T. tinca to shift to a significantly higher trophic position, whereas intraspecific competition caused its position to shift towards elevated {$\delta$}13C. These patterns were independent of impacts on fish growth rates, which were only significantly altered when interspecific competition was elevated. In the natural fish communities, patterns of trophic niche partitioning between the model fishes was evident, with no niche sharing. Comparison of these results with those of the experiment revealed the most similar results between the two approaches were for the niche partitioning between sympatric T. tinca and C. carpio. These results indicate that trophic niche divergence facilitates the integration of introduced species into food webs, but there are differences in how this manifests between introductions that increase inter- and intraspecific competition. In entirety, these results suggest that the initial ecological response to an introduction appears to be a trophic re-organisation of the food web that minimises the trophic interactions between competing species.

Intrinsic sources are due to actions of organisms in a community, i.e., population dynamics and species interactions, while extrinsic variability is variability created by elements of habitat or environmental change. There is a growing appreciation that these two sources may interact, producing patterns of community variability that cannot be predicted or explained by focusing on a single source. We performed a field experiment that simultaneously manipulated trophic structure (intrinsic) and habitat heterogeneity (extrinsic) in order to examine the interaction between sources of variability in a South Carolina (USA) stream macroinvertebrate community. To manipulate trophic structure, we experimentally altered local abundances of crayfish which are keystone species and ecosystem engineers, while our manipulation of habitat was to alter stream substrate heterogeneity. We focused on two types of community variability as responses to our manipulations: aggregate variability (i.e., variability of summed species) and compositional variability (i.e., variability in relative abundances of species) by monitoring community composition through a 10-week experiment. We found that community dynamics shifted from patterns in variability indicative of synchrony (high aggregate variability + low compositional) to variability indicative of compensation (low aggregate variability + high compositional) along a gradient of increasing habitat heterogeneity. However, the shift in community dynamics only occurred when crayfish were present in the community. Supporting evidence from the experiment suggested that sediment engineering effects of crayfish acted as a community-wide perturbation in low-heterogeneity habitat creating synchronous dynamics. However, in high-heterogeneity enclosures, crayfish effects were moderated by refugia provided by a more complex substratum. The switch from synchronous to compensatory dynamics is significant since compensation stabilizes aggregate community properties and ecosystem functions while synchrony frequently exacerbates aggregate variability. Results from this experiment demonstrate that an interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability can alter community dynamics and that such an alteration does not occur in the absence of an interaction.},

  abstract = {Perhaps more than any other ecological discipline, invasion biology has married the practices of basic science and the application of that science. The conceptual frameworks of population regulation, metapopulations, supply-side ecology, and community assembly have all to some degree informed the regulation, management, and prevention of biological invasions. Invasion biology needs to continue to adopt emerging frameworks and paradigms to progress as both a basic and applied science. This need is urgent as the biological invasion problem continues to worsen. The development of metacommunity theory in the last two decades represents a paradigm-shifting approach to community ecology that emphasizes the multi-scale nature of community assembly and biodiversity regulation. Work on metacommunities has demonstrated that even relatively simple processes at local scales are often heavily influenced by regional-scale processes driven primarily by the dispersal of organisms. Often the influence of dispersal interacts with, or even swamps, the influence of local-scale drivers like environmental conditions and species interactions. An emphasis on dispersal and a focus on multi-scale processes enable metacommunity theory to contribute strongly to the advancement of invasion biology. Propagule pressure of invaders has been identified as one of the most important drivers facilitating invasion, so the metacommunity concept, designed to address how dispersal-driven dynamics affect community structure, can directly address many of the central questions of invasion biology. Here we revisit many of the important concepts and paradigms of biological invasions---propagule pressure, biotic resistance, enemy release, functional traits, neonative species, human-assisted transport---and view those concepts through the lens of metacommunity theory. In doing so, we accomplish several goals. First, we show that work on metacommunities has generated multiple predictions, models, and the tools that can be directly applied to invasion scenarios. Among these predictions is that invasibility of a community should decrease with both local controls on community assembly, and the dispersal rates of native species. Second, we demonstrate that framing biological invasions in metacommunity terms actually unifies several seemingly disparate concepts central to invasion biology. Finally, we recommend several courses of action for the control and management of invasive species that emerge from applying the concepts of metacommunity theory.},

  abstract = {Animal movement and resource use are essential considerations for effective environmental management, but they are challenging to quantify in expansive natural ecosystems such as oceans. We used a novel combination of fish tracking with expansive acoustic telemetry networks, stable isotope analysis and integrated modelling techniques to characterize the spatial and trophic ecology of a marine fish species, permit Trachinotus falcatus, and to address specific resource management needs in the Florida Keys. Tracking-based movement patterns indicated that permit remained primarily within the designated fisheries management unit (92\% of individuals), but they moved frequently among distinct habitat types and fisheries. Movement metrics from 109 individuals were integrated into Bayesian isotope mixing models, revealing variable reliance on seagrass- versus offshore/pelagic-based energy channels amongst individuals. Variance was driven mainly by fish habitat use and home range size (km2). A telemetry-based regional isoscape, informed by individual-level estimates of resource use (\% seagrass reliance; median = 70\%, 29\%--100\% range), illustrated connectivity among habitats and fisheries. Specifically, seagrass flats were highly connected with the Florida reef tract, with frequent movements between these habitat types and a high reliance on seagrass-based prey. There was a distinction between these fish and those occupying artificial reefs, with the latter showing high use of pelagic/offshore (i.e. planktonic) energy channels. Synthesis and applications. This study used a novel combination of telemetry, stable isotope analysis and integrated modelling techniques to identify two distinct ecotypes of a nearshore fish species, permit, in the Florida Keys. Of the two ecotypes, nearshore Florida Keys permit support multiple valuable fisheries; for these fish management should prioritize conservation of seagrass flats as a key permit food source, as well as fisheries protection measures at spawning sites on the Florida reef tract. This study highlights the capacity for integrated telemetry-isotope models to provide key insights into animal ecology that has direct implications for applied environmental management.},

We examined the relation between boldness (taken as the time to emerge from a shelter and explore a novel environment) and body size in eight populations of the poeciliid Brachyraphis episcopi originating from sites upstream and downstream of waterfalls in four rivers that run into the Panama Canal. The relation between body size and time to emerge from a shelter was positive, with larger fish taking longer to emerge. This relation differed between downstream and upstream sites, being significant in the upstream populations only. These results are best explained by a metabolic hypothesis whereby juvenile fish are compelled to emerge earlier in order to resume feeding. In the downstream sites this effect was slightly offset by the relatively greater predation threat for smaller fish, such that they delayed their emergence from cover. We discuss the underlying importance of variation in boldness and its effects on other behavioural and life history traits.},

Management of large rivers requires balancing socio-economic and political considerations with biodiversity conservation efforts. By exchanging best management practices between rivers, management efforts can be improved. However, data limitations have largely prevented comparative analyses among fish assemblages in large rivers, potentially limiting the effectiveness of shared management strategies. To improve understanding of the similarities and differences between the Upper Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers, we (1) compared environmental variables and functional traits of fish assemblages between the two systems, (2) identified traits responsible for distinguishing functional groups from one another, and (3) investigated relationships between similar functional groups of fishes and environmental variables to establish expectations for how fish assemblages in large rivers might respond to anthropogenic stressors. Regional species pools in the Upper Mississippi and Upper Yangtze Rivers were characterized by a similar composition of functional traits; the majority of species were omnivorous, had affinities for gravel or sand substrates, and produced sinking eggs. Few species were pelagic, planktivorous, or herbivorous. Functional groups in both rivers were primarily distinguished according to species' trophic habits and substrate preferences, with secondary contributions from species' water column positions and life history characteristics. Pelagic planktivores and small-bodied guarders with an affinity for structural habitat complexity tended to increase downriver in both systems, in direct association with total phosphorus concentrations, agricultural land use, and temperature. In contrast, proportions of lithophilic species with affinities for gravel or cobble substrates were highest in segments located furthest upriver. By highlighting the sensitivity of different groups of fishes to anthropogenic stressors, we provide insights into the functional ecology of fishes inhabiting the Mississippi and Yangtze Rivers.},

These papers have proved controversial, in part because of a lack of direct evidence for a mechanism to explain the phenomenon. Now, in experiments involving manipulation of the number of algal species in model stream systems, Bradley Cardinale provides one such mechanism. Uptake of nitrogen nutrients increased linearly with species richness in response to changes in flow habitats and disturbance regimes. But when niche structure was experimentally removed, the relationship disappeared. This suggests that habitats with more species take greater advantage of the niche opportunities in an environment than do less-species-rich habitats, allowing the more diverse systems to capture a greater fraction of biologically active resources such as nitrogen.},

Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2010: 19: 466--476. {\copyright} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons A/S Abstract -- Habitat complexity is a key driver of food web dynamics because physical structure dictates resource availability to a community. Changes in fish diversity can also alter trophic interactions and energy pathways in food webs. Few studies have examined the direct, indirect, and interactive effects of biodiversity and habitat complexity on fish production. We explored the effects of habitat complexity (simulated vegetation), sunfish diversity (intra- vs. inter-specific sunfish), and their interaction using a mesocosm experiment. Total fish production was examined across two levels of habitat complexity (low: 161 strands m-2 and high: 714 strands m-2) and two sunfish diversity treatments: bluegill only (Lepomis macrochirus) and bluegill, redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), and green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) combination. We also measured changes in total phosphorus, phytoplankton, periphyton, and invertebrates to explain patterns in fish production. Bluegill and total fish production were unaffected by the sunfish treatments. Habitat complexity had a large influence on food web structure by shifting primary productivity from pelagic to a more littoral pathway in the high habitat treatments. Periphyton was higher with dense vegetation, leading to reductions in total phosphorus, phytoplankton, cladoceran abundance and fish biomass. In tanks with low vegetation, bluegill exhibited increased growth. Habitat complexity can alter energy flow through food webs ultimately influencing higher trophic levels. The lack of an effect of sunfish diversity on fish production does not imply that conserving biodiversity is unimportant; rather, we suggest that understanding the context in which biodiversity is important to food web dynamics is critical to conservation planning.},

Here, we investigated the generality of a novel type of NDD mechanism that operates through the mutualistic interactions of frugivory and seed dispersal among fruit-eating birds and plants. By sampling community-wide frugivory interactions at high spatial and temporal resolution in Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Peru, Brazil and Argentina, we evaluated whether interaction frequencies between birds and fruit resources occurred more often (selection), as expected, or below expectations (under-utilization) set by the relative fruit abundance of the fruit resources of each plant species. Our models considered the influence of temporal scales of fruit availability and bird phylogeny and diets, revealing that NDD characterizes frugivory across communities. Irrespective of taxa or dietary guild, birds tended to select fruits of plant species that were proportionally rare in their communities, or that became rare following phenological fluctuations, while they mostly under-utilized abundant fruit resources. Our results demonstrate that negative density-dependence in frugivore--plant interactions provides a strong equalizing mechanism for the dispersal processes of fleshy-fruited plant species in temperate and tropical communities, likely contributing to building and sustaining plant diversity.

Weekly survival rates ranged from 93.3\% to 100\% among species, with Yellowfin Shiners experiencing the lowest survival rate. Only 2 of the 337 surviving tagged individuals lost their tags (0.6\% tag loss). Logistic regression indicated that species and body length were statistically significant predictors of survival and tag retention. Odds ratios indicated that tagged fish were 1.718 times less likely to survive than control fish, but the tagging effect was not statistically significant. Bimonthly survival was estimated by conducting a mark--recapture study from September 2015 to May 2016, which involved tagging 1,413 unique individuals of Bluehead Chub (45--75 mm TL) in a 520-m stream section and 431 individuals of Mottled Sculpin (45--75 mm) in another 740-m section. Bayesian state--space analysis of Cormack--Jolly--Seber models indicated that apparent survival did not differ between newly tagged and previously tagged (i.e., recaptured) individuals in any sampling interval, suggesting that the acute and chronic effects of tagging did not differ. Mean bimonthly apparent survival rate was 0.76 (95\% credible interval = 0.64--0.86) for Bluehead Chub and 0.74 (95\% credible interval = 0.59--0.88) for Mottled Sculpin.

Given that higher agricultural intensity can increase nutrient runoff and reduce the riparian zone and litter in-fall into streams, we predicted that generalist fish would derive less energy from the terrestrial pathway and become more omnivorous. Consistent with these predictions, we show that both mean terrestrial energy use and trophic position of the resident top consumer, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), decrease with local agricultural intensity but not with watershed-level agriculture intensity. These findings suggest that local riparian buffers can maintain trophic structure even in the face of high whole-watershed agricultural intensity.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

  abstract = {Harsh conditions (e.g., mortality and stress) reduce population growth rates directly; secondarily, they may reduce the intensity of interactions between organisms. Near-exclusive focus on the secondary effect of these forms of harshness has led ecologists to believe that they reduce the importance of ecological interactions, such as competition, and favor coexistence of even ecologically very similar species. By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance, seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities. We argue that important diversity-promoting roles for harsh and fluctuating conditions depend on deviations from the assumptions of additive effects and linear dependencies most commonly found in ecological models. Such considerations imply strong roles for species interactions in the diversity of a community.}

  abstract = {Understanding the factors that govern the commonness and rarity of individual species is a central challenge in community ecology. Empirical studies have often found that abundance is related to traits associated with competitive ability and suitability to the local environment and, more recently, also to negative conspecific density dependence. Here, we construct a theoretical framework to show how a species' abundance is, in general, expected to be dependent on its per-capita growth rate when rare and the rate at which its growth rate declines with increasing abundance (strength of stabilization). We argue that per-capita growth rate when rare can be interpreted as competitive ability and that strength of stabilization largely reflects negative conspecific inhibition. We then analyze a simple spatially implicit model in which each species is defined by three parameters that affect its juvenile survival: its generalized competitive effect on others, its generalized response to competition, and an additional negative effect on conspecifics. This model facilitates the stable coexistence of an arbitrarily large number of species and qualitatively reproduces empirical relationships between abundance, competitive ability, and negative conspecific density dependence. Our results provide theoretical support for the combined roles of competitive ability and negative density dependence in the determination of species abundances in real ecosystems, and suggest new avenues of research for understanding abundance in models and in real communities.},

  abstract = {Prediction is one of the last frontiers in ecology. Indeed, predicting fine-scale species composition in natural systems is a complex challenge as multiple abiotic and biotic processes operate simultaneously to determine local species abundances. On the one hand, species intrinsic performance and their tolerance limits to different abiotic pressures modulate species abundances. On the other hand, there is growing recognition that species interactions play an equally important role in limiting or promoting such abundances within ecological communities. Here, we present a joint effort between ecologists and data scientists to use data-driven models to predict species abundances using reasonably easy to obtain data. We propose a sequential data-driven modeling approach that in a first step predicts the potential species abundances based on abiotic variables, and in a second step uses these predictions to model the realized abundances once accounting for species competition. Using a curated data set over five years we predict fine-scale species abundances in a highly diverse annual plant community. Our models show a remarkable spatial predictive accuracy using only easy-to-measure variables in the field, yet such predictive power is lost when temporal dynamics are taken into account. This result suggests that predicting future abundances requires longer time series analysis to capture enough variability. In addition, we show that these data-driven models can also suggest how to improve mechanistic models by adding missing variables that affect species performance such as particular soil conditions (e.g. carbonate availability in our case). Robust models for predicting fine-scale species composition informed by the mechanistic understanding of the underlying abiotic and biotic processes can be a pivotal tool for conservation, especially given the human-induced rapid environmental changes we are experiencing. This objective can be achieved by promoting the knowledge gained with classic modelling approaches in ecology and recently developed data-driven models.},

  abstract = {Animal movement at localised scales is often modulated by competing pressures such as avoiding predators while acquiring resources and mates. The relative magnitude of these trade-offs may affect males and females differently, often resulting in sex-specific differences in movement. Sex-biases in movement have been linked to mating systems (e.g. monogamy or polygamy) in birds and mammals; however, this relationship has received less attention among fishes. Using passive integrated transponder tags and a series of stationary antennas, we evaluated the movement dynamics of a small-bodied, sexually dimorphic stream fish Fundulus olivaceus over a 30-day period in a fourth-order tributary to the Pascagoula River in Mississippi (U.S.A.). We documented dissimilar sex-specific movement behaviours at different spatial scales that were likely to be facilitated by differential resource demands and competitive pressures. Females exhibited an increased propensity to engage in longer, exploratory moves ({$>$}30 m); whereas most males remained active within an established territory, making few long-distance longitudinal movements. Local activity levels (proportion of individuals moving) were positively related to density (manipulated during the study), and density was found to affect the magnitude of sex-specific movement. In contrast to females, males increased local activity and movement distance at the reduced density, presumably to expand territory size or mate-searching behaviours, suggesting local mate competition may suppress the movement distance of males. Despite some evidence substantiating a relationship between movement and mating system, our results suggest that the documented sex-specific differences may be related to traits that co-evolve with mating systems, rather than the mating system per se. Our findings also highlight the importance of spatial scale when evaluating patterns of sex-biased movement tendencies.},

At the birth of the metapopulation concept, only colonization was considered (i.e., movement to empty patches). However, all patches within a metapopulation are, to some extent, exchanging individuals due to dispersal, even those that are already occupied. This phenomenon leads to a re-enforcement of the extant local populations (the rescue effect). This chapter focuses on condition-dependent dispersal because it is important to take condition dependence into account to make realistic predictions about the dispersal evolution and its consequences. In more recent developments of metapopulation theory, dispersal has been considered to be a function of the density in the patch of departure and other features such as the patch size and the distance between patches. In addition to these attempts, dispersal was largely considered to be unconditional of the status of the individual, the potential donor, and recipient patches, as well as the matrix between patches.},

  abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that individuals leave their natal area and select a breeding habitat non-randomly by relying upon information about their natal and future breeding environments. This variation in dispersal is not only based on external information (condition dependence) but also depends upon the internal state of individuals (phenotype dependence). As a consequence, not all dispersers are of the same quality or search for the same habitats. In addition, the individual's state is characterized by morphological, physiological or behavioural attributes that might themselves serve as a cue altering the habitat choice of conspecifics. These combined effects of internal and external information have the potential to generate complex movement patterns and could influence population dynamics and colonization processes. Here, we highlight three particular processes that link condition-dependent dispersal, phenotype-dependent dispersal and habitat choice strategies: (1) the relationship between the cause of departure and the dispersers' phenotype; (2) the relationship between the cause of departure and the settlement behaviour and (3) the concept of informed dispersal, where individuals gather and transfer information before and during their movements through the landscape. We review the empirical evidence for these processes with a special emphasis on vertebrate and arthropod model systems, and present case studies that have quantified the impacts of these processes on spatially structured population dynamics. We also discuss recent literature providing strong evidence that individual variation in dispersal has an important impact on both reinforcement and colonization success and therefore must be taken into account when predicting ecological responses to global warming and habitat fragmentation.},

The assumption that trophic coupling is common remains largely untested, despite evidence that individual behaviors might limit trophic coupling. We used stable isotope data from common bottlenose dolphins across the Gulf of Mexico to determine if these apex predators coupled estuarine and adjacent, nearshore marine habitats. {$\delta$}13C values differed among the sites, likely driven by environmental factors that varied at each site, such as freshwater input and seagrass cover. Within most sites, {$\delta$}13C values differed such that dolphins sampled in the upper reaches of embayments had values indicative of estuarine habitats while those sampled outside or in lower reaches of embayments had values indicative of marine habitats. {$\delta$}15N values were more similar among and within sites than {$\delta$}13C values. Data from multiple tissues within individuals corroborated that most dolphins consistently used a narrow range of habitats but fed at similar trophic levels in estuarine and marine habitats. Because these dolphins exhibited individual habitat specialization, they likely do not contribute to trophic coupling between estuarine and adjacent marine habitats at a regional scale, suggesting that not all mobile, apex predators trophically couple adjacent habitats.},

Despite the technique's ubiquity, most laboratory experiments determining TDFs and incorporation rates have focused on birds, mammals, and fish; we know little about terrestrial ectotherms, and amphibians in particular are understudied. In this study we used two controlled feeding experiments to determine carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) isotope TDFs for skin, whole blood, and bone collagen and incorporation rates for skin and whole blood in adult green frogs, Lithobates clamitans. The mean ({\textpm}SD) TDFs for {$\delta$}13C were 0.1‰ ({\textpm}0.4‰) for skin, 0.5‰ ({\textpm}0.5‰) for whole blood, and 1.6‰ (0.6‰) for bone collagen. The mean ({\textpm}SD) TDFs for {$\delta$}15N were 2.3‰ ({\textpm}0.5‰) for skin, 2.3‰ ({\textpm}0.4‰) for whole blood, and 3.1‰ ({\textpm}0.6‰) for bone collagen. A combination of different isotopic incorporation models was best supported by our data. Carbon in skin was the only tissue in which incorporation was best explained by two compartments, which had half-lives of 89 and 8 d. The half-life of carbon in whole blood was 69 d. Half-lives for nitrogen were 75 d for skin and 71 d for whole blood. Our results help fill a taxonomic gap in our knowledge of stable isotope dynamics and provide ecologists with a method to measure anuran diets.},

We synthesized published diet data and applied a well-resolved, multilocus and time-calibrated phylogeny to reconstruct ancestral piscivory. We measured functional features of the skull and performed principal components analysis on species' values for these variables. To assess the role of piscivory on morphological diversification, we compared the fit of several models of evolution for each principal component (PC), where model parameters were allowed to vary between lineages that differed in degree of piscivory. According to the best-fitting model, two adaptive peaks influenced PC 1 evolution, one peak shared between highly and moderately piscivorous lineages and another for nonpiscivores. Brownian motion better fit PCs 2, 3, and 4, but the best Brownian models infer a slow rate of PC 2 evolution shared among all piscivores and a uniquely slow rate of PC 4 evolution in highly piscivorous lineages. These results suggest that piscivory limits feeding morphology diversification, but this effect is most severe in lineages that exhibit an extreme form of this diet.},

Evelyn Hutchinson provides a powerful way to conceptualize and analyze biogeographical distributions in relation to spatial environmental patterns. Both Joseph Grinnell and Charles Elton had attributed niches to environments. Attributing niches, instead, to species, allowed Hutchinson's key innovation: the formal severing of physical place from environment that is expressed by the duality. In biogeography, the physical world (a spatial extension of what Hutchinson called the biotope) is conceived as a map, each point (or cell) of which is characterized by its geographical coordinates and the local values of n environmental attributes at a given time. Exactly the same n environmental attributes define the corresponding niche space, as niche axes, allowing reciprocal projections between the geographic distribution of a species, actual or potential, past or future, and its niche. In biogeographical terms, the realized niche has come to express not only the effects of species interactions (as Hutchinson intended), but also constraints of dispersal limitation and the lack of contemporary environments corresponding to parts of the fundamental niche. Hutchinson's duality has been used to classify and map environments; model potential species distributions under past, present, and future climates; study the distributions of invasive species; discover new species; and simulate increasingly more realistic worlds, leading to spatially explicit, stochastic models that encompass speciation, extinction, range expansion, and evolutionary adaptation to changing environments.},

  abstract = {Enhancing our understanding of fish dispersal is central to the success of modern-\-day conservation efforts in freshwater ecosystems. However, methods seeking to estimate dispersal are diverse; ranging from direct estimation of individual movements, computation of dispersal kernels, to indirect assessment using measures of gene flow across riverscapes. An important question is whether results from these different approaches provide a consistent picture of the spatial scales of dispersal. Here, we performed a review and meta-\-analysis of the literature reporting both individual movements and genetic data to characterize patterns of dispersal for riverine fishes globally. Across all the studies considered (Ndirect = 206; Nindirect = 205), our results suggest restricted magnitudes of dispersal for riverine fishes, but highlight a large heterogeneity among species, taxonomic orders and geographies. For instance, we found that the maximum parent--offspring dispersal distances varied from 69 m to 1,086 km (median = 12 km; Nspecies = 107), whereas the dispersal spread derived from isolation-\-by-\-distance slopes ({$\sigma$}IBD) from genetic data ranged from 19 m to 250 km (median = 1 km; Nspecies = 56). Comparisons of species-\-specific values also revealed significant and positive relationships between direct and indirect estimates of dispersal distances, indicating that organismal movement ability often translates into effective transmission of genes. Finally, this global overview pointed to important geographic and taxonomic disparities in the study of dispersal for riverine fishes. We thus encourage researchers to broaden the taxonomic and geographical scope of future investigations and identify emerging research frontiers where new scientific efforts are needed.},

  abstract = {To see whether real ecosystems (as opposed to model ones) are stable, i.e., whether they exhibit resistance to short-term perturbations or adjustment following them, stable equilibria must be identified. To do this and still avoid trivial results, certain criteria of scale must be satisfied. To judge resistance, the strength of the perturbation capable of overcoming it must be estimated, and this usually requires experimentation. On a temporal scale, the fate of all adults of the population or community must either be followed for a minimal period of at least one complete turnover, or their replacement probabilities estimated. In regard to space, if one finds instability, this may apply only to the area studied, not to larger areas. However it is useful to define the spatial scale for which instability versus stability applies. An analysis of census data from many long-term studies revealed a continuum of temporal variability in the dynamics of natural populations and communities. There is no clear demarcation between assemblages that may exist in an equilibrium state and those that do not. Only a few examples of what might be stable limit cycles were found. There was no evidence of multiple stable states in unexploited natural populations or communities. Previously published claims for their existence either have used inappropriate scales in time or space, or have compared populations or communities living in very different physical environments, or have simply misconstrued the evidence. Rather than the physicist's classical ideas of stability, the concept of persistence within stochastically defined bounds is, in our opinion, more applicable to real ecological systems.}

Movement can be driven by a variety of biological, physiological and environmental factors occurring across all spatial and temporal scales. The intrinsic capacity of movement to impact fish individually (e.g., foraging) with potential knock-on effects throughout the ecosystem (e.g., food web dynamics) has garnered considerable interest in the field of movement ecology. The advancement of technology in recent decades, in combination with ever-growing threats to freshwater and marine systems, has further spurred empirical research and theoretical considerations. Given the rapid expansion within the field of movement ecology and its significant role in informing management and conservation efforts, a contemporary and multidisciplinary review about the various components influencing movement is outstanding. Using an established conceptual framework for movement ecology as a guide (i.e., Nathan et al., 2008: 19052), we synthesized the environmental and individual factors that affect the movement of fishes. Specifically, internal (e.g., energy acquisition, endocrinology, and homeostasis) and external (biotic and abiotic) environmental elements are discussed, as well as the different processes that influence individual-level (or population) decisions, such as navigation cues, motion capacity, propagation characteristics and group behaviours. In addition to environmental drivers and individual movement factors, we also explored how associated strategies help survival by optimizing physiological and other biological states. Next, we identified how movement ecology is increasingly being incorporated into management and conservation by highlighting the inherent benefits that spatio-temporal fish behaviour imbues into policy, regulatory, and remediation planning. Finally, we considered the future of movement ecology by evaluating ongoing technological innovations and both the challenges and opportunities that these advancements create for scientists and managers. As aquatic ecosystems continue to face alarming climate (and other human-driven) issues that impact animal movements, the comprehensive and multidisciplinary assessment of movement ecology will be instrumental in developing plans to guide research and promote sustainability measures for aquatic resources.},

  abstract = {In response to temporal changes in the quality and availability of food resources, consumers should adjust their foraging behavior in a manner that maximizes energy and nutrient intake and, when resources are limiting, minimizes dietary overlap with other consumers. Floodplains of the Amazon and its lowland tributaries are characterized by strong, yet predictable, hydrological seasonality, seasonal availability of fruits, seeds, and other food resources of terrestrial origin, and diverse assemblages of frugivorous fishes, including morphologically similar species of several characiform families. Here, we investigated how diets of frugivorous fishes in the Amazon change in response to fluctuations in food availability, and how this influences patterns of interspecific dietary overlap. We tested predictions from classical theories of foraging and resource competition by estimating changes in diet breadth and overlap across seasons. We monitored fruiting phenology to assess food availability, and surveyed local fish populations during three hydrological seasons in an oligotrophic river and an adjacent oxbow lake in the Colombian Amazon. We analyzed stomach contents and stable isotope data to evaluate temporal and interspecific relationships for dietary composition, breadth, and overlap. Diets of six species of characiform fishes representing three genera changed according to seasonal fluctuations in food availability, and patterns of diet breadth and interspecific overlap during the peak flood pulse were consistent with predictions of optimal foraging theory. During times of high fruit abundance, fishes consumed items to which their functional morphological traits seemed best adapted, potentially enhancing net energy and nutritional gains. As the annual flood pulse subsided and availability of forest food resources in aquatic habitats changed, there was not a consistent pattern of diet breadth expansion or compression. Nonetheless, shifts in both diet composition and stable isotope ratios of consumer tissues during this period resulted in trophic niche segregation in a pattern consistent with competition theory.},

Although the act of moving from one habitat to another entails major costs to the disperser, empirical and theoretical studies suggest that these costs can be reduced by having morphological, physiological or behavioural specializations for dispersal. A few recent studies on different systems showed that individuals exhibit personality-dependent dispersal, meaning that dispersal tendency is associated with boldness, sociability or aggressiveness. Indeed, in several species, dispersers not only develop behavioural differences at the onset of dispersal, but display these behavioural characteristics through their life cycle. While personality-dependent dispersal has been demonstrated in only a few species, we believe that it is a widespread phenomenon with important ecological consequences. Here, we review the evidence for behavioural differences between dispersers and residents, to what extent they constitute personalities. We also examine how a link between personality traits and dispersal behaviours can be produced and how personality-dependent dispersal affects the dynamics of metapopulations and biological invasions. Finally, we suggest future research directions for population biologists, behavioural ecologists and conservation biologists such as how the direction and the strength of the relationship between personality traits and dispersal vary with ecological contexts.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe role of predators (particularly top predators such as fish) in structuring stream communities has been debated for 2 decades. Much of the debate may have been caused by the lack of a conceptual framework for evaluating predator effects in stream communities. First, I propose a general conceptual model of the factors (abiotic, such as stream permanence and disturbance regime; biotic, such as predation) that can influence community structure, and the conditions in which these various factors would be expected to be important. Hydrologic permanence and disturbance transitions separate streams where abiotic factors are most important in determining community structure from streams with relatively benign disturbance regimes where predation may be more important. Second, I focus on the potential effect of predators in perennial streams with relatively benign disturbance regimes. Such streams are divided longitudinally into sections where different types of predators might be important in determining community structure. Large invertebrates (stoneflies, dragonflies, shrimp, and crayfish) and salamanders may be the dominant benthic predators affecting species composition in small perennial fishless streams. A transition from invertebrate- and amphibian-dominated to fish-dominated systems may occur in larger, downstream sections (predator transition 1). In addition, longitudinal transitions in fish-assemblage structure from upstream tributaries to downstream main-channel fish assemblages (predator transition 2) may affect community structure. I present evidence supporting the above model and suggest experimental approaches to test the model. This conceptual framework may help in understanding the role of specific predators in determining prey distributions in many stream communities.},

We examined the movement patterns of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) in the Arima river of Trinidad and predicted that sexual asymmetry in reproductive investment would result in male-biased movement. Since male guppies maximize their reproductive success by mating with as many different females as possible, there should be strong selection for males to move in search of mates. In agreement with our prediction, the percentage of fish that emigrated from release pools was higher for males than females (27.3\% vs. 6.9\%, respectively). Sex ratio was highly variable among pools and may influence a male's decision to emigrate or continue moving. We also detected a positive relationship between body length and the probability of emigration for males and a significant bias for upstream movement by males. Among the few females that did emigrate, a positive correlation was observed between body length and distance moved. Sex-biased movement appears to be related to mating systems in fishes, but the evidence is very limited. Given the implications for ecology, evolution, and conservation, future studies should explicitly address the influence of sex and mating systems on movement patterns.},

Although the relationship between conspecific density and emigration has been well studied, little attention has been paid to how interspecific competitor density affects another species' movement behavior. We conducted releases of two species of competing Tribolium flour beetles at different densities, alone and together in homogeneous microcosms, and tested whether their recaptures-with-distance were well described by a random-diffusion model. We also determined whether mean displacement distances varied with the release density of conspecific and heterospecific beetles. A diffusion model provided a good fit to the redistribution of T. castaneum and T. confusum at all release densities, explaining an average of {$>$}60\% of the variation in recaptures. For both species, mean displacement (directly proportional to the diffusion rate) exhibited a humped-shaped relationship with conspecific density. Finally, we found that both species of beetle impacted the within-patch movement rates of the other species, but the effect depended on density. For T. castaneum in the highest density treatment, the addition of equal numbers of T. castaneum or T. confusum had the same effect, with mean displacements reduced by approximately one half. The same result occurred for T. confusum released at an intermediate density. In both cases, it was total beetle abundance, not species identity that mattered to mean displacement. We suggest that displacement or diffusion rates that exhibit a nonlinear relationship with density or depend on the presence or abundance of interacting species should be considered when attempting to predict the spatial spread of populations or scaling up to heterogeneous landscapes.},

In this paper, I describe a radio-tracking study of golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) in the Broken River, Australia that aims to assess the home range concept as a means of describing the movements of these species. 2 A random movement analysis and a translocation experiment were conducted to test for site fidelity and home range occupation. Both golden perch and carp exhibited strong site fidelity and occupied restricted home ranges. Carp had larger total home ranges than golden perch, and both species had areas of concentrated use (core areas) within the home range. 3 Several golden perch and carp exhibited shifts in the locations of their home ranges during the study. To incorporate such shifts into a theoretical framework, a `home range shift' conceptual model is proposed and the need to consider the temporal stability of site fidelity when describing home range movements is discussed.},

This potential weakness in ecological interpretation can be overcome by using other investigative tools that provide precise information about individual movement patterns. In this paper, we demonstrate the value of combining SIA with telemetry or mark-recapture data from trapping, electrofishing and remote detection of individuals to study the movement and feeding ecology of fishes in different habitats. In a fjord lake system in Newfoundland, Canada, juvenile Atlantic salmon delayed downstream migration (smolts) or actively moved into a large lake (parr) where they foraged for periods reflecting different life history strategies. In the Miramichi River (New Brunswick, Canada), SIA provided evidence of distinct foraging habitats (tributary versus large river). By tracking fish implanted with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, we distinguished between movements related to foraging versus seeking cool water refugia during high temperature events. Finally, site fidelity and limited mobility of slimy sculpin, a small benthic fish, was established where {$\delta$}13C in muscle tissue showed a progressive enrichment downstream and where a median displacement of {$<$}10~m was estimated for sculpin tagged with PIT tags. Technological improvements have permitted non-destructive tissue sampling of wild fishes for SIA, and the tagging and remote detection of animals smaller than was previously possible. These advancements and the combination of investigative tools promise new insights into animal ecology.},

Trout moved upstream 65-100 km during the spring after ice loss over a protracted 4-month period (April-July). Summer movements were minimal, and habitats were deep pools and runs with cover in the same reaches each year. Trout moved short distances ({$<$}10 km) to spawning areas in the fall (September). Downstream movements were observed for both postspawned and immature trout. By the time of the river freeze-up (January), major movements had ceased and trout wintered in the lower to middle reaches of the main river, with only one trout leaving the river. That fish remained in habitats with salinity less than 5‰ during winter and returned to the river by May.

However, many studies examine dispersal as a neutral process, independent of community context or intraspecific variation in dispersal behaviour. Here, we use controlled, replicated communities of two Tribolium species (T. castaneum and T. confusum) to examine how intraspecific variation in dispersal behaviour and community context influence dispersal dynamics in simple experimental landscapes composed of homogeneous habitat patches. We found considerable individual-level variation in dispersal probability that was unrelated to body size variation. Further, the context of dispersal mattered, as T. castaneum dispersal was reduced in two-species communities, while T. confusum dispersal was unaffected by community composition. Incorporating individual-level variation into a two-species stochastic spatial Ricker model, we provide evidence that individual-level variability in dispersal behaviour results in more variable spatial spread than assuming individuals have the same dispersal probability. Further, interspecific competition resulted in more variable spatial spread. The variability in spatial spread observed in our tightly controlled and replicated experimental system and in our stochastic model simulations points to potential fundamental limitations in forecasting species shifting ranges without considering potential interspecific interactions and demographic variability in dispersal behaviour.},

Eastern Oklahoma represents the southwestern edge of the species' range and is where the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation focuses its stream habitat management efforts. Water temperature, streamflow, and habitat differed between Baron Fork Creek (northeast) and the Glover River (southeast) and changed longitudinally within each stream. Smallmouth bass abundance was highest downstream in Baron Fork Creek and lowest downstream in the Glover River. Recruitment was poor and variable in the upstream reaches of both streams and was strong and stable downstream in Baron Fork Creek. The survival of age-1 and older smallmouth bass was higher in Baron Fork Creek than in the Glover River. The relative weights of smallmouth bass were higher in Baron Fork Creek than in the Glover River upstream, and they decreased downstream in Baron Fork Creek. Growth was highest from summer to fall, and relative weights were lowest in spring and highest in summer. Survival was typically lowest from summer to fall. Movement among channel units was highest from fall to winter, and there was evidence that older individuals moved more often. Smallmouth bass used different habitats for overwintering versus spring spawning, and they used most deep habitats in summer and fall. Integrating population dynamics with stream habitat helped to identify habitat management strategies that can best enhance smallmouth bass populations at the edge of their native distribution, where they provide important recreational fishing opportunities to anglers.},

  abstract = {Understanding the functional significance of shelter for animal populations requires knowledge of the behavioural mechanisms that govern the dynamics of shelter use. Exploitation of shelters may be impeded by mutual interference, yet interference competition can be difficult to distinguish from exploitation competition. We used bullheads (Cottus gobio) as a model system of mobile fish to investigate the effect of intraspecific competition on shelter use. A series of field experiments was conducted under controlled conditions of shelter availability and population density. For each experiment, the location of each individual fish was observed over a period of 10~days. We then constructed a continuous-time Markov-chain model for the movement of fish between shelters and the open stream, which explicitly parameterised exploitation competition and interference competition for shelter and which accounted for two different size-classes of fish. By using a stochastic rather than a deterministic model, we were able to account for the distribution of fish across shelters, and not just the average occupation. Analysis of the model showed strong evidence of exploitation competition, which was highly dependent on body size, and an increased departure rate from shared shelters. Over and above exploitation, interference competition limited the ability of unsheltered fish to colonise vacant shelters at high population densities. Different formulations of the interference competition were compared using the Akaike Information Criterion. The formulation that best fitted the observations modelled interference competition as an increasing function of average shelter occupancy rather than population density per se.},

  abstract = {1. Flood-pulsed wetlands make vital contributions to local and global biodiversity. However, the patterns and controls of spatial and temporal variation in aquatic biodiversity in flood-pulsed wetlands are not well understood. We analysed the relationship between variation in hydrological regime and the patterns of aquatic biodiversity in a large pristine flood-pulsed wetland, the Okavango Delta, Botswana. 2. Surveys of water chemistry, diatoms and macroinvertebrates were conducted over the seasonal phases of the flood pulse. Hydrological variables of flood frequency and hydroperiod class were collated from 16 years of satellite images. Multivariate regression trees and generalised least squares regression were used to determine the chief controls of community composition and taxon richness. 3. Hydroperiod class, phase of the flood and conductivity explained 32\% and 43\% of the variation in diatom and invertebrate taxon richness, respectively. There was a negative relationship between hydroperiod class and invertebrate taxon richness on the rising, peak and receding flood, whereas at low flood there was no significant relationship. Multivariate regression tree analysis revealed hydroperiod class, phase of the flood and conductivity as the dominant forces shaping invertebrate and diatom community composition. 4. Seasonal and spatial variation in hydrological conditions are the principal drivers of variation in aquatic biodiversity in flood-pulsed wetlands. In pristine flood-pulsed wetlands, increased productivity caused by the arrival of the flood waters appears to override disturbance and connectivity in shaping taxon richness and community composition. Thus, these data suggest that the maintenance of a rich mosaic of habitats covering a broad range of hydroperiod is the key to preserving aquatic biodiversity and natural ecosystem function in flood-pulsed wetlands.},

  abstract = {Natal dispersal is defined as the movement between the natal range and the site of first breeding and is one of the most important processes in population dynamics. The choice an individual makes between dispersal and philopatry may be condition dependent, influenced by either phenotypic attributes and/or environmental factors. Interindividual variability in dispersal tactics has profound consequences for population dynamics, particularly with respect to metapopulation maintenance. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this variability is thus of primary interest. We investigated the ranging behaviour of 60 juvenile European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, monitored with GPS collars for 1 year prior to their first reproduction, from 2003 to 2010 in South-West France. Dispersal occurs across a spatial continuum so that dividing individuals into two categories (dispersers vs. philopatric) may lead to information loss. Therefore, to investigate condition-dependent dispersal more accurately, we developed an individual-based measure of dispersal distance, which took into account interindividual variation in ranging behaviour. We assessed the influence of body mass, the degree of habitat heterogeneity and sex on dispersal initiation date, dispersal propensity and distance. The overall population dispersal rate was 0{$\cdot$}34, with a mean {\textpm} SD linear distance between natal and post-dispersal home ranges of 12{$\cdot$}3 {\textpm} 10{$\cdot$}5 km. Dispersal distances followed a classical leptokurtic distribution. We found no sex bias in either dispersal rate or distance. Forest animals dispersed less than those living in more heterogeneous habitats. Heavier individuals dispersed with a higher probability, earlier and further than lighter individuals. Our individual-based standardised dispersal distance increased linearly with body mass, with some suggestion of a body mass threshold of 14 kg under which no individual dispersed. Natal dispersal in roe deer was thus dependent on both phenotypic attributes and environmental context. Our results suggest that population connectivity can be altered by a change in average body condition and is likely higher in the rich and heterogeneous habitats typical of modern day agricultural landscapes.},

We compared metacommunities of a wide variety of aquatic organism groups (12 groups, ranging from bacteria to fish) in the same set of 99 ponds to minimise biases inherent to meta-analyses. In the category of passive dispersers, large-bodied groups showed stronger spatial patterning than small-bodied groups suggesting an increasing impact of dispersal limitation with increasing body size. Metacommunities of organisms with the ability to fly (i.e. insect groups) showed a weaker imprint of dispersal limitation than passive dispersers with similar body size. In contrast, dispersal movements of vertebrate groups (fish and amphibians) seemed to be mainly confined to local connectivity patterns. Our results reveal that body size and dispersal mode are important drivers of metacommunity structure and these traits should therefore be considered when developing a predictive framework for metacommunity dynamics.},

Density can inform on fitness prospects, acting as a cue for either habitat quality, or competition over resources. However, when escaping competition, high local density should only increase emigration if lower-density patches are available elsewhere. Few empirical studies on dispersal have considered the effects of density at the local and landscape scale simultaneously. To explore this, we analyze 5 years of individual-based data from an experimental introduction of wild guppies Poecilia reticulata. Natal dispersal showed a decrease in local density dependence as density at the landscape level increased. Landscape density did not affect dispersal among adults, but local density-dependent dispersal switched from negative (conspecific attraction) to positive (conspecific avoidance), as the colonisation progressed. This study demonstrates that densities at various scales interact to determine dispersal, and suggests that dispersal trade-offs differ across life stages.},

Non-migratory species are the main component of stream fish communities, especially in the Neotropics, but there is little information on the characteristics of their movement. In this capture-recapture study, we describe the individual movement of the armored catfish Rineloricaria aequalicuspis in a stream in southern Brazil. We also assess whether this species displays heterogeneous movement, as well as its degree of mobility and the relationship between individual fish movement and body size and local habitat characteristics. Data on individual fish positions were obtained monthly from November 2018 to March 2019, in ten 20-m stream sections along a 430-m stream stretch. Individual fish were captured by kick sampling and measured, photographed (for later photo-identification), and released back to the stream. The movement frequency distribution was moderately leptokurtic (kurtosis\,=\,3.31), indicating heterogeneous movement with two groups of individuals, stationary and mobile. The maximum movement distances were 248~m and 208~m, downstream and upstream, respectively, while the mean movement distance was 98.6~m. Density of individuals was the main factor affecting the probability of movement, suggesting a role for resource availability and intraspecific interactions. The heterogeneous movement pattern observed for R. aequalicuspis indicates that intra-populational variability in movement behavior occurs in non-migratory stream species, which have been often assumed to be either sedentary or mobile species. We highlight that sedentary behavior should not be assumed a priori for stream fishes, not even for those species usually considered to be of low mobility, as many loricariids.},

Despite similar underlying data, Grinnellian niches are modelled with species-distribution models (SDMs), whereas Eltonian niches are modelled with ecological-network analysis, mainly because the sparsity of species-interaction data prevents the application of SDMs to Eltonian-niche modelling. Here, we propose to adapt recently developed joint species distribution models (JSDMs) to data on ecological networks, functional traits, and phylogenies to model species' Eltonian niches. JSDMs overcome sparsity and improve predictions for individual species by considering non-independent relationships among co-occurring species; this unique ability makes them particularly suited for sparse datasets such as ecological networks. Our Eltonian JSDMs reveal strong relationships between species' Eltonian niches and their functional traits and phylogeny. Moreover, we demonstrate that JSDMs can accurately predict the interactions of species for which no empirical interaction data are available, based solely on their functional traits. This facilitates prediction of new interactions in communities with altered composition, for example, following climate-change induced local extinctions or species introductions. The high interpretability of Eltonian JSDMs will provide unique insights into mechanisms underlying species interactions and the potential impacts of environmental changes and invasive species on species interactions in ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Determining the comparative impacts of increased intra- versus inter-specific competition is important in freshwater ecosystems for understanding the ecological changes that can result from activities such as fish stocking events (using alien and/or native fish species), as well as from natural processes that elevate population abundances (e.g. increased annual recruitment success). While increased inter-specific competition can result in slower growth rates and/or reduced population density in the weaker or less abundant competitor, it is important that this is assessed in relation to the impacts of increased intra-specific competition. We tested how the strength of inter-specific competition from a co-existing species varies with abundance, and how this compares with increased intra-specific competition. Fish were the model taxa, as their growth rates strongly correlate with competitive success. Replicated pond mesocosms (150 days) used chub Squalius cephalus in an allopatric control (n = 5; C5) and allopatric treatment (n = 10; C10), and in sympatric treatments (n = 5) with European barbel Barbus barbus (n = 5 (T1), 10 (T2) and 15 (T3)). Treatment effects were tested on fish-specific growth rates (SGRs), and the size and position of the trophic and isotopic niche (stomach contents and stable isotope [SI] analyses respectively). Chub SGRs were significantly higher in C5 versus all other treatments, but did not differ among the other allopatric and sympatric treatments. Chub trophic niche sizes in T1 to T3 were significantly smaller than C5, indicating more specialised diets in the presence of barbel. Chub trophic niche size in C10 was, however, larger than C5 and T1, indicating a shift to a more generalised diet as intra-specific competition increased. As SGRs reduced in treatments, so did the predicted extent of fish SI turnover, with SI data in T1 to T3 not at isotopic equilibrium with their diet in the mesocosms at the experiment's end. Following conversion of fish SI data to represent values at 95\% isotopic turnover, chub isotopic niches also revealed shifts to a more general diet as intra-specific competition increased, but to more specialised diets as inter-specific competition increased. Increased intra- and inter-specific competition impacts on the trophic and isotopic niches were contrasting; both metrics indicated niche constrictions in sympatry but niche expansions in allopatry. Impacts on fish growth were evident from both. These results emphasise that the trophic consequences of competition in freshwater fish can differ between stocking events involving the release of conspecifics or other species, with this having important considerations for how freshwater fish communities are managed for angling exploitation.},

Specifically, we analyzed guild- and species-specific isotopic niche space and niche space overlap using the SIBER and nicheROVER packages, and we evaluated length-specific and geographic contrasts in isotopes for fishes in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) of fish species were compared among four ecotype-based fish guilds: estuarine, coastal migratory pelagic (CMP), reef, and large offshore pelagic (LOP). Significant differences in the mean stable isotope values were found among fish guilds. Estuarine guild species exhibited the highest {$\delta$}13C variability, and Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus were the most isotopically diverse. Variability of {$\delta$}13C for CMP fish was comparable to that of some estuarine species, whereas reef and LOP fish were less variable. Fishes within the LOP guild had the largest {$\delta$}15N range. Reef guild fishes had the smallest isotopic niche space and LOP guild species consistently had the largest, although no species in any guild occupied as large of an isotopic niche space as Red Drum. Distinct and well-separated isotopic niches were also observed between most estuarine species and CMP species; however, high niche overlap was observed for species within the reef and LOP guilds. We found a positive relationship of {$\delta$}15N and fish TL for Red Drum, Blackfin Tuna Thunnus atlanticus, and Yellowfin Tuna T. albacares, and we found that {$\delta$}15N values for Red Drum and Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus showed distinct isotope differences between geographic areas. This study provides data not only on how species within and without ecotypes interact but also on the variability of their interactions, all of which can inform ecosystem-based fisheries management models.},

  abstract = {Population dynamics are typically affected by a combination of density-independent and density-dependent factors, the latter of which have been conceptually and theoretically linked with how variable population sizes are over time---which in turn has been tied to how prone populations are to extinction. To address evidence for the occurrence of density dependence and its relationship with population size variability (pv), we quantified each of these for 126 populations of 8 species of Salmoniformes. Using random-effects models, we partitioned variation in the strength of density dependence and the magnitude of pv between  and within species and estimated the correlation of density dependence and population size variability at both the between- and within-species levels. We found that variation in the strength of density dependence was predominately within species (I2~=~0.47). In contrast, variation in population size variability was distributed both between  and within species (I2~=~0.40). Contrary to theoretical and conceptual expectations, the strength of density dependence and the magnitude of population size variability were positively correlated at the between species level (r~=~0.90), although this estimate had 95~\% credibility intervals (Bayesian analogues to confidence intervals) that overlapped zero. The within-species correlation between density dependence and population size variability was not distinguishable from zero. Given that density dependence for Salmoniformes was highly variable within species, we next determined the joint effects of intrinsic (density-dependent) and extrinsic (density-independent) factors on the population dynamics of a threatened salmonid, the Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi). We found that density-dependent and -independent factors additively contributed to population dynamics. This finding suggests that the observed within-species variability in density dependence might be attributable to local differences in the strength of density-independent factors.},

Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the `Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as `receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed `reconciliation ecology'.},

However, the choice of monitoring method becomes highly restricted when following small organisms ({$<$}100~mm), especially in aquatic ecosystems. Stable isotopes are being increasingly used in this respect but rarely at the local spatial scale, i.e. 10--1000~s of metres. We sought to identify movement of small fishes between a main river channel and its tributary. Little overlap in isotope baseline was detected between the two channels despite some temporal variability in {$\delta$}15N of baseline indicator organisms in the main river. The individuals of two small cyprinid fish species (Leuciscus souffia and Alburnoides bipunctatus) of all the size classes (40--100~mm) caught within the tributary showed considerable heterogeneity in {$\delta$}15N values. Classification and discriminant analysis on isotope-derived data distinguished two significantly different groups. Moreover, this result was supported by further sampling of fish caught in the main river (in May and December 2006). Alternative hypotheses, such as dietary differences, biological factors, temporal shifts and spatial differences in diet, did not explain {$\delta$}15N variability. This application of stable isotopes at a relatively small spatial and temporal scales further demonstrates its potential as a tool for ecologists.},

Modelling the underlying dynamics shows that the causality from temporal to spatial niches is crucial for coexistence: for hypothetical strains which differ in the temporal niche used for reproduction so that they use equivalently low water levels for egg-laying, the dynamics show priority effects, not coexistence. While general theory on temporal niches is rather complex, we highlight the understudied possibility that timing traits cause differences in space use, and coexistence is unproblematic as it results from spatial niches.},

In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

The majority of species distribution models have been built with environmental data. Community ecology theory suggests that species co-occurrence data could also be used to predict current and potential distributions of species. Species assemblages are the products of biotic and environmental constraints on the distribution of individual species and as a result may contain valuable information for niche modeling. We compared the predictive ability of distribution models of annual grassland plants derived from either environmental or community-composition data. Composition-based models were built with the presence or absence of species at a site as predictors of site quality, whereas environment-based models were built with soil chemistry, moisture content, above-ground biomass, and solar radiation as predictors. The reproductive output of experimentally seeded individuals of 4 species and the abundance of 100 species were used to evaluate the resulting models. Community-composition data were the best predictors of both the site-specific reproductive output of sown individuals and the site-specific abundance of existing populations. Successful community-based models were robust to omission of data on the occurrence of rare species, which suggests that even very basic survey data on the occurrence of common species may be adequate for generating such models. Our results highlight the need for increased public availability of ecological survey data to facilitate community-based modeling at scales relevant to conservation.},

However, our knowledge is limited how landscape context (i.e. type and positioning of habitats) influences the structuring of metacommunities. We examined the role of environmental selection (niche-based species sorting), dispersal and drift (i.e. stochastic changes in species abundance) mechanisms on the structuring of fish metacommunities in riverscapes. We used a hierarchical design and examined metacommunity structuring (i) in individual running water habitat types, namely highland streams, lowland streams, highland rivers and lowland rivers; (ii) in landscape types, where patterns in highland and in lowland types were examined separately and (iii) at the level of the whole riverscape, where samples from all running water types were pooled. Elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) analysis, community--environmental relationships in redundancy analysis, and decay of community similarity with distance (distance decay) complemented with partial Mantel tests were used to reveal the mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Both the EMS framework and community--environment relationships revealed the prevalent role of selection (niche-based species sorting mechanisms) on fish metacommunity structuring, although stochastic variability also influenced the results. Metacommunity structures reflecting niche-based mechanisms (Clementsian or quasi-Clementsian) were observed at higher hierarchical levels (i.e. at the riverscape and the landscape type levels), while quasi-Clementsian or random patterns were found within single running water types. Distance decay relationships indicated that dispersal limitation did not clearly affect metacommunity structuring in any combination of running water types. Partial Mantel tests showed that some part of the variation in distance decay could be explained by the correlation between environmental variables and fish assemblage structure in some habitat types, which further suggests the importance of niche-based mechanisms in metacommunity structuring. Our study shows that different metacommunity structures can arise in a hierarchy of habitat types in riverscapes, and niche-based species sorting mechanisms are more influential in their structuring than dispersal ones. Landscape classifications are useful for a better understanding of the structuring of metacommunities in both the freshwater and terrestrial realms.},

Here, we applied elements of metacommunity structure to examine variations in the spatial distributions of stream fishes over time and to explore possible structuring mechanisms. Although the major environmental gradients influencing species distributions remained largely the same in time, the best-fit pattern of metacommunity structure varied according to sampling occasion and whether or not we included non-native species in the analyses. Quasi-Clementsian and Clementsian structures were the predominant best-fit structures, indicating the importance of species turnover among sites and the existence of more or less discrete community boundaries. The environmental gradient most correlated with metacommunity structure was defined by altitude, area of artificial ponds in the catchment, and dissolved oxygen content. Our results suggest that the best-fit metacommunity structure of the native species can change in time in this catchment due to seasonal changes in distribution patterns. However, the distribution of non-native species throughout the landscape homogenizes the temporal variability in metacommunity structure of native species. Further studies are necessary from other regions to examine best-fit metacommunity structures of stream fishes within relatively short environmental gradients.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Ecosystem engineers facilitate beneficiary species by ameliorating physical habitat. The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts the importance of facilitation in communities should increase with physical stress but has rarely been tested in freshwater. Bluehead Chubs (Nocomis leptocephalus) build gravel nests for spawning, which can reduce negative effects of sedimentation for lithophilic species including invertebrates and other taxa. Our goal was to test the SGH using chubs and benthic assemblages as a model system. We surveyed assemblages in chub nests, paired unmodified substrate and reach-wide samples in 10 Piedmont streams in South Carolina, USA, placed across a gradient of sedimentation. Based on the SGH, we predicted benthic assemblage diversity in chub nests would show no relationship to increasing embeddedness but that diversity in unmodified substrate should decrease with embeddedness. We found that taxa counts, richness and Shannon diversity were higher in chub nests than unmodified substrate but were lower than reach-wide samples. Canonical correspondence analyses indicated benthic assemblages differed between nests and unmodified substrate, but assemblages in both microhabitats were nested subsets of the more diverse reach-wide assemblage. Contrary to our hypotheses, diversity in both microhabitats decreased significantly with substrate embeddedness but was consistently higher in nests. While substrate modification by chubs clearly facilitated benthic diversity at the microhabitat scale, it was not sufficient to overcome the worst effects of sedimentation. This study provides mixed evidence for SGH in streams; chub nesting appears to be facilitative at the microhabitat scale but may not have reach-wide effects on benthic assemblages in this system.},

  abstract = {In this paper we argue that landscape spatial structure is of central importance in understanding the effects of fragmentation on population survival. Landscape spatial structure is the spatial relationships among habitat patches and the matrix in which they are embedded. Many general models of subdivided populations make the assumptions that (1) all habitat patches are equivalent in size and quality and (2) all local populations (in the patches) are equally accessible by dispersers. Models that gloss over spatial details of landscape structure can be useful for theoretical developments but will almost always be misleading when applied to real-world conservation problems. We show that local extinctions of fragmented populations are common. From this it follows that recolonization of local extinctions is critical for regional survival of fragmented populations. The probability of recolonization depends on (1) spatial relationships among landscape elements used by the population, including habitat patches for breeding and elements of the inter-patch matrix through which dispersers move, (2) dispersal characteristics of the organism of interest, and (3) temporal changes in the landscape structure. For endangered species, which are typically restricted in their dispersal range and in the kinds of habitat through which they can disperse, these factors are of primary importance and must be explicitly considered in management decisions.},

  abstract = {Biologists have long sought to predict the distribution of species across landscapes to understand biodiversity patterns and dynamics. These efforts usually integrate ecological niche and dispersal dynamics, but evolution can also mediate these ecological dynamics. Species that disperse well and arrive early might adapt to local conditions, which creates an evolution-mediated priority effect that alters biodiversity patterns. Yet, dispersal is also a trait that can evolve and affect evolution-mediated priority effects. We developed an individual-based model where populations of competing species can adapt not only to local environments but also to different dispersal probabilities. We found that lower regional species diversity selects for populations with higher dispersal probabilities and stronger evolution-mediated priority effects. When all species evolved dispersal, they monopolized fewer patches and did so at the same rates. When only one of the species evolved dispersal, it evolved lower dispersal than highly dispersive species and monopolized habitats once freed from maladaptive gene flow. Overall, we demonstrate that dispersal evolution can shape evolution-mediated priority effects when provided with a greater ecological opportunity in species-poor communities. Dispersal- and evolution-mediated priority effects probably play greater roles in species-poor regions like the upper latitudes, isolated islands and in changing environments.

Few studies, however, have examined how variation in intra- and interspecific resource use affect trophic interactions over time within a seasonally-dynamic food web. We compared diets with respect to predator body size and predator species identity over 3 seasons by collecting stomach contents from 2028 Reticulate Sculpin (Cottus perplexus), 479 Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), and 107 Pacific Giant Salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) in western Oregon streams. In each season, predator body size was strongly associated with dietary composition and positively related to taxonomic breadth and the size of individual prey. Intra- and interspecific diet variation changed substantially across seasons, with much greater interspecific variation in spring than in summer and autumn. Interspecific differences in foraging mode (e.g., benthic vs drift feeding) were associated with predator-specific responses to a seasonal pulse in the availability of terrestrial thrip larvae (Thysanoptera) and contributed to temporal variation in trophic niche differentiation. These findings show that the relative magnitudes of intra- and interspecific diet differentiation can change over time in systems that receive seasonal resource pulses. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of food webs and the need to incorporate sampling over relevant temporal scales to understand species interactions.},

In general, S. malma inhabit upstream reaches and S. leucomaenis extend downstream to the ocean. Factors influencing their distribution were analyzed at four spatial scales ranging from the whole island to individual stream pools. At the island scale, S. leucomaenis were found in the warmer south-west region and at lower altitudes elsewhere, whereas S. malma were found in the colder north-east and at higher altitudes. At a regional scale, the downstream limit of S. malma and upstream limit of S. leucomaenis shifted to lower altitude from south-west to north-east across the island, coincident with the decrease in temperature. Further analysis showed that transition points from S. leucomaenis or sympatry to S. malma in individual watersheds were closely related to an index of cumulative mean monthly temperatures exceeding 5{$^\circ$}C. However, at the scale of a single watershed, the transition occurred at different altitudes, gradients, and temperatures in two tributaries, apparently because stream discharge, habitat, and disturbances from floods interacted with these abiotic factors to limit distribution. The two charr species developed interspecific dominance hierarchies in individual pools, and there was strong complementary density compensation among stream pools that could be explained by interspecific competition but not by differences in habitat. However, patterns at watershed and regional scales suggested that interspecific competition interacts with temperature in complex ways. We conclude that the importance of various abiotic and biotic factors in shaping Hokkaido charr distributions depends on the scale at which they are viewed.},

  abstract = {Coexistence of species requires equalizing mechanisms that minimize fitness differences, which are balanced by stabilizing mechanisms that enhance negative intraspecific interactions versus interspecific ones. Here, we develop a simple theoretical framework that allows measuring the relative strength of intraspecific versus interspecific competition in dominance hierarchies. We use it to evaluate mechanisms promoting coexistence between two congeneric charr that compete for foraging positions, which strongly influence density-dependent growth and survival. Agonistic interactions (n = 761) among 71 Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma and whitespotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis were measured by snorkelling in two pools in the sympatric zone of a Hokkaido stream during two summers. Interspecific dominance hierarchies, analysed using three methods, were closely correlated with fish length but the species treated each other equally. Ranks for the most dominant fish in each pool, determined directly by knockout experiments, were also virtually identical to ranks by length. Similarly, exponential random graph modelling of the social networks provided no evidence that either species was dominant over the other. Instead, larger fish were more likely to win contests, especially over fish of the next lower ranks. These results demonstrated that the two species were nearly ecological equivalents in accessing key resources in this sympatric zone. Nearly identical growth and stable densities over 4 years further supported this inference, although Dolly Varden were a minority (29\% of the assemblage), a sign of some fitness difference. Detailed foraging observations coupled with two concurrent studies revealed an effective stabilizing mechanism. Dolly Varden shifted to feeding directly from the benthos when drifting invertebrates declined, a behaviour enhanced by morphological character displacement, thereby partitioning food resources and enhancing intraspecific competition while avoiding agonistic encounters with whitespotted charr. The plurality of evidence indicates that fitness differences between these ecologically equivalent species are small in this local assemblage, and balanced by resource partitioning, a modest stabilizing mechanism that promotes coexistence. The theoretical framework presented here is a useful tool to evaluate the strength of interspecific versus intraspecific competition, which combined with information on trade-offs in ecological performance can contribute to a mechanistic understanding of species coexistence.},

  abstract = {The present study investigates the population structure and dynamics of Cottus gobio in three adjoining, hydrologically very different stream sections that are affected by water abstraction (residual flow). During the one-year investigation from October 1997 to September 1998 the selected stretches were repeatedly sampled by electrofishing. Multiple mark-recapture method was applied to determine fish density along the individual stretches and the individual marking technique (VI-tag) was used to record the migratory activity of individual fish. Stretches with intermittent flow (section A) are temporarily colonised by adult Cottus gobio from downstream sites only at higher water levels. These stretches are completely dry for about half of the year and do not enable populations to become established. Small populations persist in those transitional stretches that are intermittently isolated from other surface waters (section B). However, population size is less than one-quarter the size of those in directly adjoining downstream stretches with permanent water flow (section C). In addition, bullheads in section B have considerably poorer conditions. Changes in discharge led to increased migratory activity over the entire study area, whereby the radius of activity of the bullhead was largely (88\%) restricted to distances of {$<$} 150 m. Elevated discharges mostly triggered upstream longitudinal and lateral dispersion. When the water drops to low water level and large areas in these sections dry out, the bullheads have to withdraw into deep pools. This might be the main reason for the lack of the probably less mobile juvenile stages. The results clearly demonstrate that habitat fragmentation resulting from water abstraction has drastic effects on all life stages of Cottus gobioin respect to habitat availability, spatial distribution, movement, fitness and survival. These effects can be seen at an extremely fine scale and are revealed in the significant differences in abundance and condition of Cottus gobiobetween the short (94 m-188 m) adjacent sections. In order to maintain and restore ecological integrity of running waters, the preservation of intact flow conditions is one of the key issues for river management.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Leptokurtic distributions of movement distances observed in field-release studies, in which some individuals move long distances while most remain at or near their release point, are a common feature of mobile animals. However, because leptokurtosis is predicted to be transient in homogeneous populations, persistent leptokurtosis suggests a population heterogeneity. We found evidence for a heterogeneity that may generate persistent leptokurtosis. We tested individuals of the Trinidad killifish Rivulus hartii for boldness in a tank test and released them back into their native stream. Boldness in the tank test predicted distance moved in the field releases, even after effects of size and sex were removed. Further, data from a 19-mo mark-recapture study showed that individual growth correlated positively with movement in a predator-threatened river zone where the Rivulus population is spatially fragmented and dispersal is likely to be a hazardous activity. In contrast, no such correlation existed in a predator-absent zone where the population is unfragmented. These results show that a behavioral trait, not discernible from body size or sex, contributes to dispersal and that a component of fitness of surviving ``dispersers'' is elevated above that of ``stayers,'' a fundamental assumption or prediction of many models of the evolution of dispersal through hazardous habitat.},

I marked fishes with subcutaneous injections of acrylic paints to indicate capture location within a 550-m long study site. Recaptures over an 18-month period primarily occurred within 33 m of the original capture location, suggesting longterm residence in relatively small areas. However, 11 Percina and three Lepomis moved at least 100 m (maximum distance moved = 200 m for Lepomis, 420 m for Percina), and individuals of both species shifted between distinctly different mesohabitats (boulder riffle, sand pool, and gravel riffle). Distance moved did not strongly relate to time between captures. Long-distance movements ({$>$} 33 m) by Percina mostly occurred from Nov. through June. The winter and spring-time movements by darters occurred in upstream and downstream directions and into all three mesohabitats, and at least 40\% of these movements were unassociated with periods of extreme high flow. Periodic long-range movements may allow small fishes to respond to variation in resources over a large area and across a variety of stream habitats.},

We show that both factors consistently increased emigration rates and use metacommunity modelling to highlight consequences on local and regional dynamics. In a coordinated distributed dispersal experiment involving seven laboratories, the authors show that both top-down predation risk and bottom-up resource limitation increase emigration rates across 21 species ranging from protozoa to vertebrates.},

Generally, dispersal decisions are condition-dependent and rely on information in the broad sense, like the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard condition-dependence. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is condition-dependent and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement depend on and are adjusted by the strength of interspecific interactions. We found that the predicting movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and interspecific interaction strengths. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking interspecific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of condition-dependence for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.},

As a spatial process, range expansions are driven by dispersal and movement behaviour. Although it is widely accepted that dispersal and movement may be context-dependent, for instance density-dependent, and best represented by reaction norms, the evolution of density-dependent movement during range expansions has received little experimental attention. We therefore tested current theory predicting the evolution of increased movement at low densities at range margins using highly replicated and controlled range expansion experiments across multiple genotypes of the protist model system Tetrahymena thermophila. Although rare, we found evolutionary changes during range expansions even in the absence of initial standing genetic variation. Range expansions led to the evolution of negatively density-dependent movement at range margins. In addition, we report the evolution of increased intrastrain competitive ability and concurrently decreased population growth rates in range cores. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding movement and dispersal as evolving reaction norms and plastic life-history traits of central relevance for range expansions, biological invasions and the dynamics of spatially structured systems in general.},

One conventional method of calculating the dispersal kernel assumes that the distribution of displacements are Gaussian (e.g. resulting from a diffusion process) and that individuals remain within sampled areas. The first assumption prohibits an analysis of dispersal data that do not exhibit the Gaussian distribution (a common situation); the second assumption leads to underestimation of dispersal distance because individuals that disperse outside of sampling areas are never recaptured. Our method eliminates these two assumptions. In addition, the method can also accommodate mortality during a sampling period. This new method uses integrodifference equations to express the probability of spatial mark-recapture data; associated dispersal, survival, and recapture parameters are then estimated using a maximum likelihood method. We examined the accuracy of the estimators by applying the method to simulated data sets. Our method suggests designs for future mark-recapture experiments.},

Initial compositional variation caused plant communities to remain divergent in species identities, even though these same communities converged strongly in species traits. This contrast between species divergence and trait convergence could not be explained by dispersal limitation or community neutrality alone. Our results show that the simultaneous operation of trait-based assembly rules and species-level priority effects drives community assembly, making it both deterministic and historically contingent, but at different levels of community organization.},

  abstract = {Eight hundred forty-six reports of tagged fish caught by anglers were analyzed to determine the movement patterns of 14 species of native warm-water stream fishes. Each species included a sedentary group which remained near the release point and a mobile group which ranged more or less freely. The species could be classified according to the relative abundance of the two groups. Rock bass, smallmouth bass, longear sunfish, spotted bass, and yellow bullhead were classified as sedentary species; carp, flathead catfish, largemouth bass, golden redhorse, and black redhorse are semi-mobile; and channel catfish, freshwater drum, and white crappie as mobile. The species varied greatly in the average number of days between tagging and recapture and in the direction of movement and distances traveled by the mobile fish. The mobile group usually was free longer than the sedentary fish but frequently the difference in time was not great. Mobile freshwater drum, golden redhorse, black redhorse, spotted bass, largemouth bass, and longear sunfish tended to travel relatively long distances downstream and much shorter distances upstream. The distances traveled by the remaining species were more nearly equal but the average distance traveled upstream was always the longer. Mobile yellow bullhead, green sunfish, spotted bass, longear sunfish, and largemouth bass seldom traveled more than 25 miles but some mobile carp moved over 200 miles. Other species traveled intermediate distances. When released in headwaters, sedentary species tended to be more sedentary, and semi-mobile species in their preferred habitat also tended to be more sedentary than the average. Mobile spcies and semi-mobile species not in their preferred habitat became more mobile. Most of the mobile fish released in headwaters moved downstream. For the four most numerous species (rock bass, channel catfish, carp, smallmouth bass) data are presented to show the effect of release location, season, and age upon movement. Rock bass were more sedentary in headwaters than farther downstream but channel catfish were more mobile in headwaters. Mobile fish of both species tended to move downstream when released in headwaters but to make more upstream movements when released in down stream areas. Carp seemed to adapt their movements to the physical conditions in the habitat. They were mostly sedentary in stable habitats but predominantly mobile in habitats subject to flooding. The subspecies of the fish, the type of stream, and the geographical location of the release site may have effected the amount and direction of movements of smallmouth bass. All four species showed a relatively high proportion of mobile fish in the spring and low proportions in the summer. Data on fall movements were not conclusive. Rock bass, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass of intermediate age were more mobile than either the younger or the older fish. The concept that the native population of warm-water stream fish species consists of a sedentary and a mobile group provides a logical explanation of many observed phenomena and of contradictory results which have confused some investigators. It supplements recent findings concerning the home ranges of species if it is assumed that only the sedentary group was investigated.},

However, results showed that fin-muscle correction models should be specific and sampling design should be conducted to reduce spatial and temporal variation. Moreover, species-specific correction factors may not be valid for other populations of the same species if the presumed range of {$\delta$}X values differ from the population used to estimate the correction models. Results also showed that the fin-muscle relationship could vary with size. Thus, unless a non-ecological meaningful fin-muscle correlation with body size was previously identified, correction models should be estimated sampling a representative size range and fin samples should be used with caution to study size-related trophodynamics.},

  abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems are in the midst of a biodiversity crisis marked by non-random and often dramatic shifts in fish community composition. Yet, the patterns and underlying ecological drivers of these community dynamics within gravel pit lakes---widespread artificial lakes with significant socioeconomic and ecological value---remain understudied. This study examines patterns and drivers of beta-diversity of fish communities across 16 gravel pit lakes in southwestern France over 10 years. Our results unveiled strong shifts in fish community composition, with lake maturity (older and more productive) emerging as the main driver. Immature lakes experienced substantial species turnover over one decade, harbouring more unique fish communities, whereas mature lakes showed little change, contributing less to overall beta-diversity. Highly invaded lakes displayed higher levels of species nestedness than species turnover compared with uninvaded lakes. The contributions of native and non-native species to beta-diversity remained relatively constant on average over the study period, although with some notable exceptions. Non-native species such as common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Wels catfish (Silurus glanis) had increasing contributions to beta-diversity, whereas native European perch (Perca fluviatilis) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) were increasingly more common (i.e., widespread) despite declining biomass when present. A number of abiotic and biotic factors likely contributed to the diversity patterns observed. Eutrophication is associated with increasing turbidity and hypoxia/anoxia, promoting the dominance of more tolerant, largely non-native, fish species. The higher proportion of species nestedness in invaded communities may stem from reduced invasibility or local extinctions over time. Finally, European perch, a pioneer species, exhibited increasing homogenisation of its biomass across lakes over the 10-year period, resulting in similar small populations distributed throughout the study area. These findings highlight temporal changes in fish community composition within gravel pit lakes, revealing the complex interplay between lake maturity and non-native species dynamics as major drivers.},

  abstract = {1 In a population with Allee effects a positive relationship exists between fitness and population size or density. Allee effects may result in extinction thresholds and are therefore crucial in conservation and management. It has been shown theoretically that Allee effects can be driven by predation; however, there are few empirical data. Previous empirical work on Allee effects has emphasized that taxa with life-history characteristics such as co-operative breeding may be prone to such effects. Because predation is a general ecological mechanism, Allee effects may be more widespread than previously thought. 2 We used a series of simple heuristic models to develop a theoretical framework for understanding predation-driven Allee effects as a function of predator functional and aggregative responses. 3 Predators can create an Allee effect if they have a type I (linear) or type II (saturating) functional response without a type III (sigmoid) aggregative response, or vice versa. In addition, predation must be the main driver of prey dynamics, and prey must have little spatial or temporal refuge from predation. 4 We highlighted several, mainly unrecognized, examples of predation-driven Allee effects from the literature, the majority of which came from systems that had been perturbed by exploitation or introduced predators. 5 Synthesis and applications. Allee effects can arise from a general ecological process under a variety of different combinations of functional and aggregative responses. Allee effects may thus be present in a broad spectrum of different taxa with different types of life history, not only those taxa, such as broadcast spawners and co-operative breeders, on which empirical work has focused thus far. Conservation biologists and managers working with heavily exploited or threatened populations, or attempting reintroductions, should be aware of the possibility of a threshold population size or density below which extinction is likely. These thresholds can occur regardless of species life history, if predation is a major source of mortality and spatial and temporal predation refuges are limited.},

We sampled quarterly over a 3-year period (1985--1988) at six 800- to 2300-m-long sites in 2 streams near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Overall, distances between successive captures were {$<$} 100 m for approximately two-thirds of all fishes.

In general, all species were highly sedentary in both streams, with rock bass and redbreast sunfish being the most sedentary and bluegill and largemouth bass being the least. In most instances, redbreast sunfish showed the same distribution of distances between captures regardless of the interval between captures (1 week, 3 months, 6 months or more). This species also tended to be more mobile in the spring and less mobile in the winter, with large fish exibiting the greatest distances between captures. Some redbreast sunfish showed a very restricted home range, being captured 3 or more times over {$\geq$} 6 months in the same 50-m section of stream. A few individuals moved 4-9 km only to return to their original location, but most fish exhibited behaviors intermediate between these extremes. For all species, upstream and downstream movements were equally common, although movements in one direction predominated at some sites for limited periods of time.

  abstract = {Movement by stream fish is known to be strongly influenced by abiotic factors such as floods and temperature, but roles of biotic factors, such as predation threat, and interactions of abiotic and biotic factors are less clear. Predation threat is known to fragment populations of killifish, Rivulus hartii, in Trinidad rivers by rendering habitat inhospitable. We asked whether such spatial fragmentation was accompanied by reduced movement by fish in the predator-occupied zone of a river, relative to a zone free of the strong piscivore, Hoplias malabaricus, that causes the fragmentation. We used a 19-mo marking study in a river with a predator barrier, field experiments in the river, and mesocosms to evaluate four hypotheses: (1) the predator reduces prey movement in the river; (2) for the special case of prey leaving refugia, the predator increases movement; (3) movement positively correlates with water level in the predator's presence; and (4) complex physical structure in hazardous habitat promotes prey movement. We marked 1467 Rivulus in the natural study areas and had 1015 recaptures. Contrary to Hypothesis 1 but in support of Hypothesis 2, prey showed greater movement along the river in the presence of the predator, regardless of whether the fish resided in a refuge at its previous capture. An experiment with introduced fish confirmed the findings that movement was elevated in the predator's presence. Effects of an abiotic factor (water level, Hypothesis 3) and a phenotypic trait (body size) depended upon whether the predator was present: movement was independent of water level and body size in the absence of the predator, but positively related to both variables in the predator's presence. Emigration from the river to tributaries was also independent of body size in the predator's absence, but positively size-dependent in the predator's presence. Complex physical structure (Hypothesis 4), in the form of cobble added to experimental pools, enhanced the transit of fish through hazardous pools. This study shows that spatial fragmentation does not necessarily imply that movement between fragments will be impeded (dynamical fragmentation). Rather, it is possible that movement among spatial fragments may be enhanced by the same factor, predation threat, that produced the spatial fragmentation in the first place. Because of the context-dependent effects of an abiotic factor (water level) and a phenotypic variable (body size) on movement, the study also emphasizes the need to clarify the exact role of predation as an agent promoting or retarding movement, and it suggests a need for incorporating such parameters into models of movement and metapopulation dynamics.},

Then, it examines the relationships between metapopulation dynamics, the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, and the dynamics of populations living in patchy environments. It further tackles practical issues and the links between metapopulation dynamics and landscape ecology, and between metapopulation dynamics and conservation biology. Chapters 4 and 5 present structured models describing changes in the number of individuals within patches and an empirical evaluation of local extinction in metapopulation studies. The subsequent chapters discuss several aspects of metapopulation, including dispersal and connectivity, colonization, conspecific attraction, extinction and isolation, and forest fragmentation. The latter chapters describe the concept of habitat fragmentation, the diversity and competition in metapopulations, the community collapse, and the effects of metapopulation studies in predator-prey systems.},

We used stable isotope analysis of hair and fur samples collected from four regions of sympatry for Canada lynx ({$<$}italic{$>$}Lynx canadensis{$<$}/italic{$>$}) and bobcat ({$<$}italic{$>$}Lynx rufus{$<$}/italic{$>$}) spanning southern Canada and the northern United States, to test the prediction that the more generalist species (bobcat) exhibits a wider dietary niche than the more specialist species (Canada lynx) and that this pattern is consistent across different regions. We further predicted that Canada lynx diet would consistently exhibit greater overlap with that of bobcat compared to overlap of bobcat diet with Canada lynx. We found that Canada lynx had a narrower dietary niche than bobcat, with a high probability of overlap (85--95\%) with bobcat, whereas the bobcat dietary niche had up to a 50\% probability of overlap with Canada lynx. These patterns of dietary niche breadth and overlap were consistent across geographic regions despite some regional variation in diet breadth and position, for both species. Such consistent patterns could reflect a lack of plasticity in species dietary niches. Given the increasingly recognized importance of understanding dietary niche breadth and overlap across large spatial scales, further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms by which broad-scale patterns are maintained across species and systems.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Movements were inferred from recaptured fish collected over a 12-month period. Recaptures within release pools were proportionally greater than movements outside release pools, although the sampling technique used likely overestimated recaptures within release pools. Recaptures outside release pools were more frequent in late spring and early summer, coinciding with the N. lutipinnis spawning season.

Numerous studies have supported the restricted movement paradigm, but nearly all have relied on the recapture of marked fish from the same areas in which they were released, an approach we believe is biased against detecting movement. We found substantial movement of trout in streams in Colorado and Wyoming using two-way weirs and radio telemetry. A review of the research on Lawrence Creek, Wisconsin, also showed that movement was important in the response of the trout population to habitat enhancement. Movement of resident stream fish has profound implications for research (e.g., measuring production and habitat models) and management (e.g., habitat enhancement, special regulations, and stocking hatchery fish). Methods capable of detecting fish movement could be incorporated into many studies to assess its importance in systems of interest. New theories and experiments are needed to understand the mechanisms that cause stream salmonids to move.},

Diversity can increase stability through the portfolio effect, while higher synchrony generally decreases stability. In turn, species interactions and similar responses to environmental variation are considered the main factors underlying the strength of interspecific synchrony, despite the challenges in determining their relative roles. The analysis of the relationship between interspecific synchrony and the trait (or phylogenetic) distance between species can increase the robustness of inferences about these factors. Here, we used pairwise interspecific and community-wide analyses to investigate, respectively, the drivers of interspecific synchrony and the influence of trait and phylogenetic diversity on the stability of fish communities. For that, we used 18 years of fish abundance data from the Upper Paran{\'a} River floodplain. At the interspecific level, we used quantile regressions to test within-guild relationships between interspecific synchrony and trait and phylogenetic distance between species. At the community level, we tested the relationships between community-wide synchrony, stability, and (trait and phylogenetic) diversity. We found that interspecific synchrony decreased with trait and phylogenetic distances. In the community-level analysis, we found that more synchronous fish communities were less stable, but the relationship between diversity and stability was in general weak. At the interspecific level, our study highlights the role of similar responses to environmental variation in driving species' temporal dynamics. At the community level, the strength of the relationships between trait or phylogenetic diversity and community stability depended on the feeding guild. On the other hand, we found strong relationships between synchrony and stability. These results suggest that increased synchrony levels in response to regional environmental changes could decrease the stability of fish communities in this floodplain.},

Determining the generality of this relationship, and discovering the mechanisms that underlie it, are vitally important for ecosystem management. Here, we investigate how species richness affects the temporal stability of biomass production by reanalyzing 27 recent biodiversity experiments conducted with primary producers. We find that, in grasslands, increasing species richness stabilizes whole-community biomass but destabilizes the dynamics of constituent populations. Community biomass is stabilized because species richness impacts mean biomass more strongly than its variance. In algal communities, species richness has a minimal effect on community stability because richness affects the mean and variance of biomass nearly equally. Using a new measure of synchrony among species, we find that for both grasslands and algae, temporal correlations in species biomass are lower when species are grown together in polyculture than when grown alone in monoculture. These results suggest that interspecific interactions tend to stabilize community biomass in diverse communities. Contrary to prevailing theory, we found no evidence that species' responses to environmental variation in monoculture predicted the strength of diversity's stabilizing effect.

  abstract = {Stable isotope analysis has emerged as an important tool in aquatic ecology. For fish, dorsal muscle from sacrificed individuals has traditionally been used in stable isotope studies; however, there are many instances when lethal sampling is undesirable. We evaluated the feasibility of using adipose and caudal fin clips as alternatives to muscle in stable isotope studies for five species of salmonids. Because fish size and water temperature can affect stable isotope ratios, we also determined whether fish length and sampling date affected the difference in isotope signatures between fins and muscle. Biopsied muscle plugs and fin clips were collected from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and lake trout S. namaycush as well as lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis and pygmy whitefish Prosopium coulterii and analyzed for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. The isotope signatures of both adipose and caudal fins were significantly correlated (0.33 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.97) with those of dorsal muscle from the five salmonid species studied, and in some cases the signatures of fins did not differ from those of muscle. Fish length and sampling date occasionally had a small effect (0.042 \&lt; R2 \&lt; 0.49) on the relationship between the isotope signatures of fin and muscle. Although muscle biopsy provides a viable, nonlethal method of collecting muscle tissue from suitably sized fish, the strong relationships between the isotope signatures of fin and muscle demonstrate that fin clips should be considered good surrogates for muscle in stable isotope studies of salmonids.},

The paradigmatic view in ecology is that emigration is density independent (DIE) or positive density dependent (+DDE). However, alternative forms are biologically plausible, including negative (-DDE), U-shaped (uDDE), and hump-shaped (hDDE) forms. We reviewed the empirical literature to assess the frequency of different forms of density-dependent emigration and whether the form depended on methodology. We also developed a reaction-diffusion model to illustrate how different forms of DDE can affect patch-level population persistence. We found 145 studies, the majority representing DIE (30\%) and +DDE (36\%). However, we also regularly found -DDE (25\%) and evidence for nonlinear DDE (9\%), including one case of uDDE and two cases of hDDE. Nonlinear DDE detection is likely hindered by the use of few density levels and small density ranges. Based on our models, DIE and +DDE promoted stable and persistent populations. uDDE and -DDE generated an Allee effect that decreases minimum patch size. Last, -DDE and hDDE models yielded bistability that allows the establishment of populations at lower densities. We conclude that the emigration process can be a diverse function of density in nature and that alternative DDE forms can have important consequences for population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) represent important analytical and predictive tools for ecologists. Until now, these models have either assumed (i) that species' occurrence probabilities are uncorrelated or (ii) that species respond linearly to preselected environmental variables. These two assumptions currently prevent ecologists from modelling assemblages with realistic co-occurrence and species richness properties. This paper introduces a stochastic feedforward neural network, called `mistnet', which makes neither assumption. Thus, unlike most SDMs, mistnet can account for non-independent co-occurrence patterns driven by unobserved environmental heterogeneity. And unlike several recently proposed joint SDMs, the model can also learn nonlinear functions relating species' occurrence probabilities to environmental predictors. Mistnet makes more accurate predictions about the North American bird communities found along Breeding Bird Survey transects than several alternative methods tested. In particular, typical assemblages held out of sample for validation were each tens of thousands of times more likely under the mistnet model than under independent combinations of single-species predictions. Apart from improved accuracy, mistnet shows two other important benefits for ecological research and management. First: by analysing co-occurrence data, mistnet can identify unmeasured -- and perhaps unanticipated -- environmental variables that drive species turnover. For example, the model identified a strong grassland/forest gradient, even though only temperature and precipitation were given as model inputs. Second: mistnet is able to take advantage of outside information to guide its predictions towards more realistic assemblages. For example, mistnet automatically adjusts its expectations to include more forest-associated species in response to a stray observation of a forest-dwelling warbler.},

However, it is unclear whether this holds true when predators and pulsed prey are in the same guild (i.e. intraguild (IG) predators and prey). IG prey may increase IG-predator food intake through predation, but they may decrease food intake through competition. To test these hypotheses, we compared the food intake of white-spotted charr (Salvelinus leucomaenis) (IG predator) in streams that were stocked or unstocked with masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) fry (IG prey) in streams in Hokkaido, Japan. One day after stocking, mean stomach content weight of charr was six times higher than in unstocked streams due to fry consumption. In particular, large charr showed intense piscivory. However, predation on fry was rare after about three weeks. Some factors that could explain this time-limited IG predation include the growth and decreasing abundance of fry over time and the acquisition of predator-avoidance behaviour. In days other than the first-day post-stocking, food intake by charr did not differ between stocked and unstocked streams. No effects of interspecific competition on charr food intake were observed.},

Consequently, knowledge of the ecological mechanisms of dispersal is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of these communities. Dispersal is often considered to occur at a constant per capita rate; however, some experiments demonstrated that dispersal may be a function of local species density. 2 Here we use aquatic experimental microcosms under controlled conditions to explore intra- and interspecific density-dependent dispersal in two protists, a prey Tetrahymena pyriformis and its predator Dileptus sp. 3 We observed intraspecific density-dependent dispersal for the prey and interspecific density-dependent dispersal for both the prey and the predator. Decreased prey density lead to an increase in predator dispersal, while prey dispersal increased with predator density. 4 Additional experiments suggest that the prey is able to detect its predator through chemical cues and to modify its dispersal behaviour accordingly. 5 Density-dependent dispersal suggests that regional processes depend on local community dynamics. We discuss the potential consequences of density-dependent dispersal on metacommunity dynamics and stability.},

  abstract = {Background Fish fin is a widely used, non-lethal sample material in studies using stable isotopes to assess the ecology of fishes. However, fish fin is composed of two distinct tissues (ray and membrane) which may have different stable isotope values and are not homogeneously distributed within a fin. As such, estimates of the stable isotope values of a fish may vary according to the section of fin sampled. Methods To assess the magnitude of this variation, we analysed carbon ({$\delta$} 13C), nitrogen ({$\delta$} 15N), hydrogen ({$\delta$} 2H) and oxygen ({$\delta$} 18O) stable isotopes of caudal fin from juvenile, riverine stages of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). Individual fins were sub-sectioned into tip, mid and base, of which a further subset were divided into ray and membrane. Findings Isotope variation between fin sections, evident in all four elements, was primarily related to differences between ray and membrane. Base sections were13C depleted relative to tip ({\textasciitilde} 1 ‰) with equivalent variation evident between ray and membrane. A similar trend was evident in {$\delta$} 2H, though the degree of variation was far greater ({\textasciitilde} 10 ‰). Base and ray sections were 18O enriched ({\textasciitilde} 2 ‰) relative to tip and membrane, respectively. Ray and membrane sections displayed longitudinal variation in 15N mirroring that of composite fin ({\textasciitilde} 1 ‰), indicating that variation in15N values was likely related to ontogenetic variation. Conclusions To account for the effects of intra-fin variability in stable isotope analyses we suggest that researchers sampling fish fin, in increasing priority, 1) also analyse muscle (or liver) tissue from a subsample of fish to calibrate their data, or 2) standardize sampling by selecting tissue only from the extreme tip of a fin, or 3) homogenize fins prior to analysis.},

Here we develop stable isotope clocks to track resource shifts in anadromous rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). We used a diet-switch experiment and model fitting to quantify N stable isotope ({$\delta$}15N) turnover rates and discrimination factors for seven tissues: plasma, liver, fin, mucus, red blood cells, muscle, and scales. Among tissues, diet-tissue {$\delta$}15N discrimination factors ranged from 1.3 to 3.4~‰. Model-supported tissue turnover half-lives ranged from 9.0 (fin) to 27.7 (scale) days. We evaluated six tissue turnover models using Akaike's information criterion corrected for small sample sizes. The use of equilibrium tissue values was supported in all tissues and two-compartment models were supported in plasma, liver, and mucus. Using parameter estimates and their uncertainty we developed stable isotope clocks to estimate the time since resource shifts. Longer turnover tissues provided accurate estimates of time since resource switch for durations approximately twice their half-life. Faster turnover tissues provided even higher precision estimates, but only within their half-life post-switch. Averaging estimates of time since resource shift from multiple tissues provided the highest precision estimates of time since resource shift for the longest duration (up to 64~days). This study therefore provides insight into physiological processes that underpin stable isotope patterns, explicitly tests alternative models, and quantifies key parameters that are the foundation of field-based stable isotope analysis.},

Although these responses are complicated by many spatial and temporal processes, long-term datasets might help reveal complex patterns and processes driving variability in species abundances. The objective of this study was to develop a predictive framework for fish community and population responses to varying levels of water availability across six sites in two intermittent stream networks sampled {$>$}10 years. We predicted that fishes would emigrate into intermittent reaches during wet conditions; thus, overall abundances within perennial source locations will decline. Accordingly, when intermittent reaches dry, fishes will contract to wetted habitats resulting in high abundance. Observed fish community abundances were highly variable within and among study sites, but four of six sites matched our predictions. A tagging study confirmed these results and demonstrated a substantial proportion of individuals moved away from perennial reaches and into newly wetted intermittent reaches. However, site and species-specific relationships were variable and likely depended on the habitat, metacommunity dynamics, and life history strategies. Findings suggest that species dispersal dynamics, in addition to recruitment and mortality, should be carefully considered when interpreting species responses to varying water levels, particularly in intermittent stream networks where access to habitat can change drastically with water availability.},

  abstract = {1. The aim of this paper is to review literature on species diversity patterns of freshwater organisms and underlying mechanisms at large spatial scales. 2. Some freshwater taxa (e.g. dragonflies, fish and frogs) follow the classical latitudinal decline in regional species richness (RSR), supporting the patterns found for major terrestrial and marine organism groups. However, the mechanisms causing this cline in most freshwater taxa are inadequately understood, although research on fish suggests that energy and history are major factors underlying the patterns in total species and endemic species richness. Recent research also suggests that not all freshwater taxa comply with the decline of species richness with latitude (e.g. stoneflies, caddisflies and salamanders), but many taxa show more complex geographical patterns in across-regions analyses. These complexities are even more profound when studies of global, continental and regional extents are compared. For example, clear latitudinal gradients may be present in regional studies but absent in global studies (e.g. macrophytes). 3. Latitudinal gradients are often especially weak in the across-ecosystems analyses, which may be attributed to local factors overriding the effects of large-scale factors on local communities. Nevertheless, local species richness (LSR) is typically linearly related to RSR (suggesting regional effects on local diversity), although saturating relationships have also been found in some occasions (suggesting strong local effects on diversity). Nestedness has often been found to be significant in freshwater studies, yet this pattern is highly variable and generally weak, suggesting also a strong beta diversity component in freshwater systems. 4. Both geographical location and local environmental factors contribute to variation in alpha diversity, nestedness and beta diversity in the freshwater realm, although the relative importance of these two groups of explanatory variables may be contingent on the spatial extent of the study. The mechanisms associated with spatial and environmental control of community structure have also been inferred in a number of studies, and most support has been found for species sorting (possibly because many freshwater studies have species sorting as their starting point), although also dispersal limitation and mass effects may be contributing to the patterns found. 5. The lack of latitudinal gradients in some freshwater taxa begs for further explanations. Such explanations may not be gained for most freshwater taxa in the near future, however, because we lack species-level information, floristic and faunistic knowledge, and standardised surveys along extensive latitudinal gradients. A challenge for macroecology is thus to use the best possible species-level information on well-understood groups (e.g. fish) or use surrogates for species-level patterns (e.g. families) and then develop hypotheses for further testing in the freshwater realm. An additional research challenge concerns understanding patterns and mechanisms associated with the relationships between alpha, beta and gamma components of species diversity. 6. Understanding the mechanistic basis of species diversity patterns should preferably be based on a combination of large-scale macroecological and landscape-scale metacommunity research. Such a research approach will help in elucidating patterns of species diversity across regional and local scales in the freshwater realm.},

  abstract = {Metacommunity ecology addresses the situation where sets of local communities are connected by the dispersal of a number of potentially interacting species. Aquatic systems (e.g. lentic versus lotic versus marine) differ from each other in connectivity and environmental heterogeneity, suggesting that metacommunity organisation also differs between major aquatic systems. Here, we review findings from observational field studies on metacommunity organisation in aquatic systems. Species sorting (i.e. species are `filtered' by environmental factors and occur only at environmentally suitable sites) prevails in aquatic systems, particularly in streams and lakes, but the degree to which dispersal limitation interacts with such environmental control varies among different systems and spatial scales. For example, mainstem rivers and marine coastal systems may be strongly affected by `mass effects' (i.e. where high dispersal rates homogenise communities to some degree at neighbouring localities, irrespective of their abiotic and biotic environmental conditions), whereas isolated lakes and ponds may be structured by dispersal limitation (i.e. some species do not occur at otherwise-suitable localities simply because sites with potential colonists are too far away). Flow directionality in running waters also differs from water movements in other systems, and this difference may also have effects on the role of dispersal in different aquatic systems. Dispersal limitation typically increases with increasing spatial distance between sites, mass effects potentially increase in importance with decreasing distance between sites, and the dispersal ability of organisms may determine the spatial extents at which species sorting and dispersal processes are most important. A better understanding of the relative roles of species sorting, mass effects and dispersal limitation in affecting aquatic metacommunities requires the following: (i) characterising dispersal rates more directly or adopting better proxies than have been used previously; (ii) considering the nature of aquatic networks; (iii) combining correlative and experimental approaches; (iv) exploring temporal aspects of metacommunity organisation and (v) applying past approaches and statistical methods innovatively for increasing our understanding of metacommunity organisation.},

  abstract = {One pervasive outcome in the urbanization of an ecosystem is the proliferation and numerical dominance of select tolerant organisms that are often native to the system yet with reduced relative abundances in less-disturbed conditions. As a result of high variation in environmental conditions between urbanized and non-urbanized systems, it is possible that the functional role of a ubiquitous organism is context dependent. Such is the case for redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus) in small streams in many parts of the Piedmont of the southeastern USA. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the feeding, growth, and trophic position of redbreast sunfish in 3 streams of increasing levels of watershed urbanization (forested, suburban, urban) in the Lower Piedmont of western Georgia, USA. Through gut contents analysis, we found that sunfish consumed primarily Chironomidae (Diptera) larvae across all streams. However, fish in the suburban stream consumed more terrestrial prey than fish in the forest and urban streams, which corresponded to lower aquatic prey abundances in the suburban stream. Although there was no difference in mean fish age among streams, otolith analysis revealed that fish in the urban stream were larger at age than those in the forest stream. Last, stable isotope analysis revealed that fish in the urban stream occupied a lower trophic position than the other 2 streams. These results suggest that despite the fact that the primary prey resource was similar for sunfish in each stream, their potential functional role, as evidenced by size at age and trophic position, is context dependent.},

The analysis is made in terms of population growth and dispersal. After this analysis, the observed parameter values are altered to investigate the sensitivity of the expected velocity to small changes in life history and long-distance dispersal. This gives an impression of how likely it is that species, once confined to a certain geographical region, expand their range, invading virgin regions beyond their former range limit. The results of this approach are compared with the common theory concerning invasion-proneness of species and biotypes. The present theory seems to offer a more parsimonious explanation of invasions than does the common theory based on static properties. /// Se analizan las invasiones de dos especies, la paloma collareja (Streptopelia decaocto Privaldszky) la cual invade Europa, y aquella de la abeja africana (Apis mellifera scutellata Ruttner) la cual ha invadido Sur America, America Central y la parte sur de America del Norte.

These include the establishment of wildlife corridors, captive breeding and release programs, and translocation of individuals among populations. Many metapopulation models show that increasing movement among populations. Many metapopulation models show that increasing movement among populations reduces the chance of metapopulation extinction. However, epidemiological models indicate that increased contact among populations enhances the spread of disease and can trigger epidemics. I have synthesized elements of mathematical epidemiology with metapopulation models. An analytic model showed that highly contagious diseases of moderate severity spread widely, increasing the probability of metapopulation extinction. I also used a simulating model to examine four spatial arrangements of populations: island, necklace, loop, and spider. When infected individuals were allowed to move freely among populations, all of the arrangements exhibited qualitative behavior similar to that exhibited by the analytic models. The most dangerous diseases were those for which infected populations grew large enough to produce dispersers that infected other populations, but which also reduced the geometric rate of increase for infected populations to near unity. Under those conditions, random demographic and environmental events caused metapopulation extinction. Major differences among the spatial arrangements emerged when a quarantine population was established. A centralized quarantine in the spider and necklace arrangement yielded the most dramatic reductions in metapopulation extinction probability. A single quarantine patch was of little value in an island arrangement. These results have several implications for managing metapopulations. Most notably, some spatial arrangements of populations are more amenable to disease control than others, and establishing a quarantine population can increase the probability of detecting new diseases and reduce the impact of diseases that do appear.},

Alternatively, fin tissue can be sampled non-lethally, avoiding the need to euthanise an animal to obtain what is usually a relatively small tissue sample. We set out to develop equations for converting {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values from derived non-lethally sampled fin tissue to equivalent white muscle tissue, for use in food-web studies. We explored {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values of paired fin-clips and white muscle from two species of anguillid fishes, the endemic longfin eel (Anguilla dieffenbachii), and the Australasian shortfin eel (A. australis), sourced from multiple studies spread throughout New Zealand. We also examined the effect of lipid extraction on {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N, which reduced variability of {$\delta$}13C when compared to untreated samples. We were also able to estimate {$\delta$}13C values of equivalent lipid-extracted muscle samples directly from untreated fin. For {$\delta$}15N, paired untreated fin and muscle values were not statistically different so fin {$\delta$}15N can be used as a direct estimate of muscle {$\delta$}15N. Solvent lipid extraction with a methanol--chloroform mixture, however, altered {$\delta$}15N values and increased variability, so should be avoided. We present equations to estimate lipid-corrected {$\delta$}13C values of muscle tissue for use in stable isotope studies of freshwater anguillids, avoiding euthanasia. Our results demonstrate that {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values can be accurately derived from non-lethally obtained fin clips, reducing unnecessary mortality in fish species of conservation concern.},

However, little information exists on the permanence of this attribute. We used mark--recapture and two-way traps to determine whether there are differences in the condition and growth of mobile and resident Bonneville cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki utah in Beaver Creek, Idaho. Actively moving fish were significantly larger than the general population, and the largest of these mobile fish were in significantly lower condition for a given size. However, mobile fish that were marked and recaptured a year later had regained condition equivalent to that of the general population upon their recapture, and the largest mobile fish had significantly greater condition than fish of equal length in the general population. In contrast, there was no relationship between growth rate and the total distance moved during the 1-year period. These results suggest that the lower condition of actively moving fish does not have permanent effects on future condition or growth in stream-resident cutthroat trout.}

  abstract = {Body size is a fundamental trait known to allometrically scale with metabolic rate and therefore a key determinant of individual development, life history, and consequently fitness. In spatially structured environments, movement is an equally important driver of fitness. Because movement is tightly coupled with body size, we expect habitat fragmentation to induce a strong selection pressure on size variation across and within species. Changes in body size distributions are then, in turn, expected to alter food web dynamics. However, no consensus has been reached on how spatial isolation and resource growth affect consumer body size distributions. Our aim was to investigate how these two factors shape the body size distribution of consumers under scenarios of size-dependent and size-independent consumer movement by applying a mechanistic, individual-based resource--consumer model. We also assessed the consequences of altered body size distributions for important ecosystem traits such as resource abundance and consumer stability. Finally, we determined those factors that explain most variation in size distributions. We demonstrate that decreasing connectivity and resource growth select for communities (or populations) consisting of larger species (or individuals) due to strong selection for the ability to move over longer distances if the movement is size-dependent. When including size-dependent movement, intermediate levels of connectivity result in increases in local size diversity. Due to this elevated functional diversity, resource uptake is maximized at the metapopulation or metacommunity level. At these intermediate levels of connectivity, size-dependent movement explains most of the observed variation in size distributions. Interestingly, local and spatial stability of consumer biomass is lowest when isolation and resource growth are high. Finally, we highlight that size-dependent movement is of vital importance for the survival of populations or communities within highly fragmented landscapes. Our results demonstrate that considering size-dependent movement is essential to understand how habitat fragmentation and resource growth shape body size distributions---and the resulting metapopulation or metacommunity dynamics---of consumers.},

We show that experimental manipulations of the abiotic or biotic environment, assessments of trait-phylogeny-environment relationships, and investigations of frequency-dependent population growth all suggest strong influences of stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences on the outcome of plant community assembly. Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and community structure. Combining current approaches represents our best chance of achieving this goal, which is fundamental to conceptual ecology and to the management of plant communities under global change.},

Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34\% focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

  year = 2010,
  abstract = {Community ecology increasingly seeks to integrate the influences of regional and historical processes with species interactions within local habitats. This broadened perspective is largely based on comparative approaches that employ ``natural experiments'' to identify factors shaping community structure. Because coastal rivers are separated from one another by insurmountable barriers (oceans or land), freshwater fishes are particularly well suited for comparative analyses of factors that influence fish community organization. In this chapter, we review how this comparative approach shed light on large-scale biodiversity gradients, community saturation, community convergence, density compensation, and the role of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in community dynamics. The main factors (e.g., river mouth discharge and history) empirically related to species richness of a river are well identified, and metacommunity ecology provides a fruitful conceptual framework for understanding how regional (river) species richness translates into local species richness. Much work remains to identify factors explaining differences among whole river basin assemblages with regard to ecological traits (e.g., trophic status and life history) composition and to assess whether trait-related environmental and biotic local filters act similarly over large spatial scales. One important conclusion that can be drawn from the studies reviewed here is that history cannot be neglected whatever the scale of investigation (global, river, or site). A second conclusion is that historical effects are not strong enough to blur the occurrence of qualitatively repeatable patterns of community structure over large spatial scale, which is encouraging because it suggests development of general predictive models of community structure is an attainable goal.},

Northern vole and lemming species are particularly well-known for their spatially synchronized population dynamics. Here, we use results from an experimental study to demonstrate that tundra vole dispersal movements did not act to synchronize population dynamics in fragmented habitats. In contrast to the constant dispersal rate assumed in earlier theoretical studies, the tundra vole, and many other species, exhibit negative density-dependent dispersal. Simulations of a simple mathematical model, parametrized on the basis of our experimental data, verify the empirical results, namely that the observed negative density-dependent dispersal did not have a significant synchronizing effect.},

Although these developments have provided ecologists with new perspectives, their full impact has been hampered by an inability to statistically compare individual communities using descriptive metrics. 2. We solve these issues by reformulating the metrics in a Bayesian framework. This reformulation takes account of uncertainty in the sampled data and naturally incorporates error arising from the sampling process, propagating it through to the derived metrics. 3. Furthermore, we develop novel multivariate ellipse-based metrics as an alternative to the currently employed Convex Hull methods when applied to single community members. We show that unlike Convex Hulls, the ellipses are unbiased with respect to sample size, and their estimation via Bayesian inference allows robust comparison to be made among data sets comprising different sample sizes. 4. These new metrics, which we call SIBER (Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R), open up more avenues for direct comparison of isotopic niches across communities. The computational code to calculate the new metrics is implemented in the free-to-download package Stable Isotope Analysis for the R statistical environment.},

  abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of phenotypes among populations is of major importance for species evolution and ecosystem functioning. Dispersal has long been assumed to homogenise populations in structured landscapes by generating maladapted gene flows, making spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes traditionally considered resulting from local adaptation or plasticity. However, there is accumulating evidence that individuals, instead of dispersing randomly in the landscapes, adjust their dispersal decisions according to their phenotype and the environmental conditions. Specifically, individuals might move in the landscape to find and settle in the environmental conditions that best match their phenotype, therefore maximizing their fitness, a hypothesis named habitat matching. Although habitat matching and associated non-random gene flows can produce spatial phenotypic heterogeneity, their potential consequences for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning are still poorly understood. Here, we discuss evidence for intra and interspecific drivers of habitat matching, and highlight the potential consequences of this process for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning. We conclude that habitat matching might deeply affect the eco-evolutionary dynamics of meta-systems, pointing out the need for further empirical and theoretical research on its incidence and implications for species and communities evolution under environmental changes.},

  abstract = {-- Using data from an ongoing study of juvenile Atlantic salmon growth and survival in tributaries of the Connecticut River, USA, we compare standard population-level approaches to those focusing on individuals. We highlight the potential benefits of resampling individually tagged stream fish as compared to standard approaches. Specifically we focus on growth, survival, movements and population estimation. The advantages of estimating sizes and growth rates from individual size trajectories include obtaining growth histories and the ability to perform retrospective analysis of the consequences of different life-history strategies. An example might be the patterns of growth leading to either early maturity or migration. Resampling known individuals is the only way we know to chart both short-term and long-term movements and to assign growth and mortality consequences to such movements. Finally, individual-level data permit robust estimation of survival and density/abundance using methods such as Cormack/Jolly-Seber. The results indicate that population estimates were about 10\% lower using individual data than using population data, that survival from sample to sample was typically {$>$}90\%, that the majority of recaptured fish did not move during the summer, that growth was rapid during spring and most fish lost mass during the summer and that growth trajectories for maturing and non-maturing fish showed substantially different patterns. An individual-based approach to stream fish ecology provides the opportunity to explore the mechanisms responsible for population-level patterns but comes at the cost of significant field effort. Tradeoffs between increased data resolution and the effort required to obtain the data must be considered before undertaking individual-based field studies of stream fishes.NOTE},

We examined how the three main metacommunity factors---environmental conditions, spatial processes and species associations---affect metacommunity structure and whether responses are predictable in real-world systems by using novel methods to disentangle the drivers.

  abstract = {Mangrove plants, which develop highly productive forests on tropical--subtropical coastlines and river estuaries, rely mainly on river and sea water currents for their diaspore dispersal. Mangrove diaspores are basically dispersed in brackish to sea waters; thus whether they sink or float during the dispersal period could be changed dynamically, both spatially and temporally, depending on the salinity to which they are exposed, as well as on their specific gravity (SG). We found that the SG of diaspores of two mangrove species, Rhizophora stylosa and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, which are dominant species and form a typical zonation (B. gymnorrhiza in inland areas and R. stylosa in more seaward areas) in the study area, changed spatially and temporally. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza gradually lost its SG in accordance with elapsed time, while R. stylosa lost its SG in the first 6 h and gained gradually according to elapsed time. Hydrodynamic simulation of dispersal patterns, in combination with observed specific gravity changes of both diaspores and river water, demonstrated that the spatio-temporal pattern of specific gravity change was closely related to the difference in dispersal behaviors between the species. The diaspore of B. gymnorrhiza generally disperses upstream, and covers wider ranges than that of R. stylosa, at least in the early phase of dispersal. These dispersal behaviors agreed well with the distribution pattern of the species across estuaries in the study site. To date, hydrochory has been considered to be a mostly passive process governed by the dynamics of water current and subsequent sediment movement, with fixed diaspore characteristics such as shape and buoyancy. The present study shed new light on an active and dynamic process in hydrochory and found that the buoyancy of diaspores may be controlled by changes in their spatial and temporal SG.},

Contrary to predictions, from 28 to 60\% of marked fish moved at least one habitat unit, and immigration of unmarked fish also indicated considerable movement. Upstream movement predominated but the stream with the step-pool/cascade channel type had fewer upstream movers and greater distances moved downstream. Coho movers were not smaller than nonmovers, as predicted based on assumptions that movement results from competitive exclusion. Habitat units that coho left were smaller and shallower but lower in density than units where coho remained. Thus, movement is a common phenomenon rather than an aberration, and may reflect habitat choice rather than territorial eviction. Moreover, movers grew faster than nonmovers, so the "mobile fraction" of the population was not composed of competitively inferior fish but rather individuals that thrived. The phenomenon of small-scale habitat- and growth-related movements should be considered when planning and interpreting studies of juvenile salmonid ecology in streams.},

In this paper, we conducted a three-day laboratory study to evaluate whether metrics of body condition affected movement of wild-caught creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) at 16 and 22{$^\circ$}C. Movement was counted between two circular tanks connected by a straight corridor, which was equipped with a pair of passive integrated transponder antennas. Fish movement was most frequent during periods of darkness in a simulated photoperiod, and more mobile individuals consistently moved more frequently across the 3 days. In general, individuals in better body condition were more mobile than those in poorer condition, and different metrics of body condition affected movement to different degrees. Specifically, per cent weight loss and dry matter content (ratio of wet versus dehydrated weight) were better predictors of movement than weight-at-length, which is most typically used as a surrogate of body condition in animals. In addition, body condition and length interacted to affect fish movement, where body condition affected movement of smaller individuals more significantly than that of larger individuals. Body condition effects on activity were similar at 16 and 22{$^\circ$}C. This study demonstrates that body condition metrics may not always affect certain behavior in a similar way. Body condition metrics need to be carefully selected when used in the context of animal behavior, and more than a single metric should be tested when feasible.},

We developed a Bayesian integrated population model using individual mark-recapture and count data to characterize fine-scale movement of stream fish at 20-m resolution in a 740-m study area~every two months for 28~months. Our study targeted small-bodied fish, for which imperfect capture was accounted for (bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus and mottled sculpin Cottus bairdii). Based on data from 2021 individuals across all species, we found that proportions of immigrants in 20-m sections~averaged 30--42\% among the study species, but they varied over space and time. Creek chub immigrants increased during warmer intervals when individuals grew more and transitioned between body size classes, suggesting that immigration was due to ontogenetic habitat shifts. There was a weak pattern across the species that individuals were more likely to leave 20-m sections when flow was higher. Water-column species (bluehead chub and creek chub) were more likely to immigrate into and stay in deeper sections with more pool area. Across all species and occasions, number of immigrants to stream sections did not decrease with number of individuals that survived and stayed in the same sections. Thus, the habitat did not appear saturated, and our data provided no evidence that intra-specific interactions affected fine-scale movement at our fish densities. In conclusion, high turnover rates characterized fish movement among stream sections and their variation was associated with temporal and spatial shifts in abiotic conditions.},

However, fixed PIT antenna data showed that as much as 17\% of marked individuals emigrated from the study area during the 2-month study period. Probability of emigration did not depend on where in the 1-km segment individuals had been released, indicating that emigration likely represented long-distance movement. Once emigrants made a decision to emigrate, they left the tributary within 1--3 median days by moving downstream in a unidirectional manner, based on detections at a total of three antenna arrays deployed throughout the tributary. Our multiscale analysis provided strong support for co-existence of short- and long-distance movement patterns, and we conclude that movement data at multiple spatial scales complement each other to characterize population-scale movement.

  abstract = {Population dynamics and species interactions are spread out in space. This might seem like a trivial observation, but it has potentially important consequences. In particular, mathematical models show that the dynamics of populations can be altered fundamentally simply because organisms interact and disperse rather than being confined to one position for their entire lives. Models that deal with dispersal and spatially distributed populations are extraordinarily varied, partly because they employ three distinct characterizations of space: as 'islands' (or `metapopulations'), as `stepping-stones', or as a continuum. Moreover, there are several different ways of representing dispersal in spatially structured environments, as well as several possibilities for allowing environmental variation to come into play. In spite of this variety, a few common themes emerge from spatial models. First, island and stepping-stone models emphasize that little can be concluded from simply recording patterns of' occupancy, instead a metapopulation's fate will be determined by the balance between local extinction and recolonization and how that balance interacts with random catastrophes. Island and stepping-stone models also make it clear that the spatial dimension, in particular spatial subdivision, can alter the stability of species interactions and opportunities for coexistence in both predator---prey and competitive systems. Continuum models, which usually take the form of reaction-diffusion equations, address slightly different questions. Reaction-diffusion theory suggests that in uniform environments, certain combinations of local dynamics and dispersal can produce persistent irregularities in the dispersion of species. These striking spatial patterns, which are called diffusive instabilities, can arise from predator---prey interactions, Lotka-Volterra competitive interactions, and from density-dependent population growth in an age-structured population. Moreover, although they differ fundamentally in their structure, the three major classes of spatial models share the common generalization that spatial effects should be expected only for: (i) selected spatial scales; (ii) specific dispersal rates, and (iii) particular patterns of environmental variation relative to the frequency and range of dispersal. The theoretical possibilities are thus contingent on spatial scale and dispersal rates. Although explicit experimental tests of spatial models are non-existent, a handful of studies report general changes in species interactions associated with manipulations of habitat subdivision. Observational studies with adequate data concerning dispersal and scale are also scarce; but those few observational studies with the appropriate supporting information consistently show profound spatial effects, especially effects due to habitat subdivision. The challenge for empiricists is to investigate more rigorously the roles of spatial subdivision and dispersal in natural communities. The challenge for theoreticians is to make the empiricist's job easier; this can best be done by delineating when spatial effects are most likely to be influential, and by offering guidance on how to design appropriate experiments. Simply saying that the spatial environment is important is to mouth a platitude: what we need to know is whether this presumed importance amounts to much in natural systems.}

Terrestrial invertebrates supported 49\% (mean{\textpm}1 SE=5.3{\texttimes}103{\textpm}0.4{\texttimes}103 mg m-2 year-1) of the annual, total prey consumption (10.9{\texttimes}103{\textpm}1.7{\texttimes}103 mg m-2 year-1) by salmonids in the forest and 53\% (2.0{\texttimes}103{\textpm}0.3{\texttimes}103 mg m-2 year-1) (3.8{\texttimes}103{\textpm}0.6{\texttimes}103 mg m-2 year-1) in the grassland reaches. 4. Salmonids were estimated to consume 51 and 35\% of the annual total (falling plus drift) input of terrestrial invertebrates in the forest and grassland reaches, respectively. The input of terrestrial invertebrates by drift, however, was almost equal to the output in both vegetation types, suggesting that the reach-based, in-stream retention of terrestrial invertebrates almost balanced these falling in. 5. Difference in the riparian vegetation, which caused spatial heterogeneity in the input of terrestrial invertebrates, could play an important role in determining the local distribution of salmonids.},

Karaca{\"o}ren reservoir is also an important local habitat for native Cyprinid fishes, Capoeta antalyensis and Squalius fellowesii. In this study, we evaluated the trophic structure and interspecies trophic interactions (as isotopic niches and niche overlaps) of these Cyprinid fish using stable C and N isotopes analysis as measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. While equally all food sources contributed to the biomass of all fish species in the summer, their biomass is supported by more specialized sources in the winter season. Our results revealed increased niche breadth with increased niche overlap between C. antalyensis and C. gibelio, and C. carpio, and among C. gibelio and C. carpio in the summer, while decreased niche breadth with decreased niche overlap in the winter season. Interspecific competition has led to trophic niche divergence, which may facilitate the coexistence of native species with introduced fishes. Non-native fish were determined to have larger niche widths, which may contribute to their invasion success.},

To address this issue, we developed a model framework in which species with distinct quantitative dispersal traits that govern the three stages of dispersal---departure, movement and settlement---compete under different ecological contexts. The model identified three primary dispersal strategies (referred to as nomadic, homebody and habitat-sorting) that consistently dominated metacommunities owing to the interplay of spatiotemporal environmental variation and different types of competitive interactions. We outlined the key characteristics of each strategy and formulated theoretical predictions regarding the abiotic and biotic conditions under which each strategy is more likely to prevail in metacommunities. By presenting our results as relationships between dispersal traits and well-known ecological gradients (e.g. seasonality), we were able to contrast our theoretical findings with previous empirical research. Our model demonstrates how landscape environmental characteristics and competitive interactions at the intra- and interspecific levels can interact to favour distinct multivariate and context-dependent dispersal strategies in metacommunities.

  abstract = {Understanding how metacommunities respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbances is a key objective in ecology. In this study, we introduce an analytical framework to identify communities whose extirpation triggers stronger (hereafter keystone communities) or weaker (hereafter idle communities) cascading effects on extinction and colonization events that ultimately drive temporal changes in compositional patterns of the remaining communities. These cascading dynamics illustrate how the loss of communities disrupts connectivity, altering dispersal patterns that ultimately shape species occupancy and dominance at the landscape scale. Through mechanistic simulation models that reproduce in silico the design of removal experiments, we demonstrated that our framework accurately estimates `keystoneness', ranking local communities by their role in maintaining metacommunity compositional patterns over time. We also use our framework and simulation models to derive a mechanistic understanding of community keystoneness, demonstrating how landscape characteristics and species pool attributes jointly shape the role of communities within the metacommunity. A key feature of our framework is its ability to generate community keystoneness estimates that are weakly correlated to local diversity, thus providing a new metric for assessing the relevance and conservation value of local communities under a metacommunity context. This feature is particularly important in cases where high local diversity reflects an influx of individuals into demographic sinks, a common consequence of human activities near natural areas. To showcase the unique insights of this framework, we examined and contrasted the effects of artificial light at night (ALAN) on the diversity and keystoneness of a moth metacommunity sampled over two decades. We conclude with a discussion of the framework's underlying assumptions, emphasizing its relevance for addressing both conceptual and applied ecological questions.},

  abstract = {1 Stable isotope analyses coupled with mixing models are being used increasingly to evaluate ecological management issues and questions. Such applications of stable isotope analyses often require simultaneous carbon and nitrogen analyses from the same sample. Correction of the carbon isotope values to take account of the varying content of 13C-depleted lipids is then frequently achieved by a lipid-normalization procedure using a model describing the relationship between change in {$\delta$}13C following lipid removal and the original C:N ratio of a sample. 2 We evaluated the applicability of two widely used normalization models using empirical data for muscle tissue from a wide range of fish and for aquatic invertebrates. Neither normalization model proved satisfactory, and we present some modifications that greatly improve the fit of one of the models to the fish muscle data. For invertebrates we found no clear relationship between change in {$\delta$}13C following lipid removal and the original C:N ratio. 3 We also examined the effect of lipid-normalization on the output of a mixing model designed to calculate the proportional contribution of prey items to the diet of a consumer. Mixing model output was greatly influenced by whether prey or consumer values alone or together were lipid-normalized and we urge caution in the interpretation of results from these models pending further experimental evidence. 4 Synthesis and applications. We describe a revised lipid-normalization model that should be applicable to a wide range of marine and freshwater fish species in studies applying stable isotope analyses to ecological management issues. However, we strongly advise against applying these kinds of lipid-normalization models to aquatic invertebrate data. The interpretation of outputs from mixing models is greatly influenced by whether the carbon isotope data have been lipid-normalized or not.},

Although effects of positive interactions have often been observed at local scales, much less is known about consequences at larger spatial scales. Here, we study nest associations of stream fishes -- widespread reproductive facilitation between host (nest-builder) and beneficiary (nest associate) species in North America -- as a model system to examine the role of positive interactions in determining the metapopulation-level relationship between host and beneficiary species. Using regional data of fish distribution in the Midwestern US, we found that watershed-level occupancy of host species (i.e. metapopulation occupancy) remarkably increased that of nest associates. Our results illustrated that the effects of positive biotic interactions at the metapopulation level were comparable or even stronger than environmental drivers, i.e. factors that have been studied most extensively in metapopulation studies. Further, our model supported the hypothesis that the metapopulation-level relationship between hosts and nest associates was mediated by a gradient of environmental conditions: strong associations occurred under stressful habitats. This study provides insightful evidence that positive biotic interactions have larger scale consequences for distributions of organisms than previously thought. Successful biodiversity conservation may need a broader framework that appreciates the role of positive biotic interactions at larger spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Aim The aim was to identify drivers of historical freshwater fish community assembly by testing for interactions between functional traits and two climatic gradients, namely elevation and latitude. Many studies conclude that environmental filtering is the dominant process of community-wide trait convergence at high elevations and high latitudes, but a full understanding of which specific filters cause trait convergence is lacking. Location Great Plains--Rocky Mountains, USA. Time period 1960--2018. Major taxa studied Freshwater fish. Methods Using 2,539 stream fish community surveys documenting the native distributions of 51 species, we evaluated trait--environment relationships (trade-offs) and trait--dispersion relationships (standardized effect sizes from null models) along elevation and latitudinal gradients in four functional trait categories. We tested whether elevation and latitude exhibited similar trait--environment and trait--dispersion relationships using four functional trait categories (life history, habitat, trophic and locomotion). We predicted that elevation and latitude would have similar relationships owing to shared environmental filters of cold stress and dispersal constraints. Results Life history was the only trait category to display evidence of increased environmental filtering along both gradients, with trait dispersion more constrained at high elevations and high latitudes. Trade-offs revealed that periodic strategies (high fecundity, low juvenile survivorship) decreased with elevation and increased with latitude, whereas equilibrium strategies (low fecundity, high juvenile survivorship) declined along both gradients. Despite the observation of predictable trade-offs for habitat, trophic and locomotion trait strategies, there was little evidence for environmental filtering of these traits at high elevations and high latitudes. Main conclusions Elevation and latitude appear to be environmental filters of freshwater fish community assembly when mediated through life-history strategies, which is likely to be attributable to thermal constraints on growth and reproduction. Our results support the role of environmental filtering in trait convergence patterns along climatic gradients, and we identify cold stress as one specific filter of community assembly.},

  abstract = {Niche Theory is a central framework in ecology based on the recognition that most interactions between organisms are indirect, mediated by the biotic and abiotic dynamical environment these organisms live in. Despite its potential generality, the theory still mostly focuses on how resource--consumer dynamics mediate competition in ecological communities. However, it is being increasingly recognized that positive interactions between organisms also play an important role in driving the structure and functioning of ecological communities, from plants to microbes. In this paper, we present a unified theory of the niche that applies to both positive and negative interactions between organisms, mediated by one or two environmental factors. We show that classical concepts such as niche differences and fundamental and realized niches can naturally be expanded to facilitative and mutualistic interactions. In addition, we introduce and formalize new general niche concepts that appear exclusively in the presence of positive interactions: (1) the Allee niche, a region of environmental conditions for which a species can persist but not invade from low densities and (2) niche facilitation, when the presence of a species expands the set of environmental conditions under which a second species can invade and/or persist. To show the broad applicability of this theory, we illustrate these concepts using a diverse set of theoretical examples, from bacteria feeding on an inhibiting substrate, to nitrogen-fixing plants and the indirect mutualism between a plant and a carnivore species. In sum, our work shows how Niche Theory provides a natural framework for positive interactions in ecology, bringing a unified perspective and new conceptual tools to study ecological systems where these positive interactions occur.},

We investigated the timing, frequency and environmental conditions associated with movements by adult golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) between the mainstem of the mid-Murray River and a tributary, the Goulburn River, in south-eastern Australia, using acoustic telemetry over four years (2007--2011). Fish were tagged and released in autumn 2007--2009 in the mid-Murray (n = 42) and lower Goulburn (n = 37) rivers within 3--6 km of the mid-Murray-lower Goulburn junction. 38\% of tagged fish undertook mainstem--tributary movements, characterised mostly by temporary occupation followed by return of fish to the original capture river. Approximately 10\% of tagged fish exhibited longer-term shifts between the mainstem and tributary. Movement of fish from the tributary into the mainstem occurred primarily during the spawning season and in some years coincided with the presence of golden perch eggs/larvae in drift samples in the mainstem. Many of the tributary-to-mainstem movements occurred during or soon after changes in flow. The movements of fish from the mainstem into the tributary were irregular and did not appear to be associated with spawning. The findings show that golden perch moved freely across the mainstem--tributary interface. This demonstrates the need to consider the spatial, behavioural and demographic interdependencies of aquatic fauna across geographic management units such as rivers.},

In this study, we investigated how the relative importance of these costs and benefits changes with increasing body length. This is of particular interest in animals such as fish, which show continuous growth throughout their lives. Our results suggest that larger fish are subject to lower predation risks and are less affected by food deprivation than small fish, with fish decreasing their responses to food--deprivation treatments more strongly with increasing body length than to predation treatments. This may explain our observation that large fish emerged later from a refuge than small ones and spent shorter times outside the refuge. The key role of differential responses to food deprivation was further illustrated by the finding that the relative weight loss of individual fish was strongly correlated with a reduction in hiding time even in the absence of body length differences. The importance of inter--individual differences in metabolic rates for the decision--making behaviour of animals is discussed.},

  abstract = {Theory predicts that consumers can increase their energy intake by spending more time within resource-rich areas and/or by avoiding areas where local competitor densities are high. A consumer whose movements are described by a simple random walk can achieve these objectives by adjusting its turn frequency and/or speed. We recorded movements, as series of steps, by 180 individual rotifers (Brachionus calyciflorus) in glass capillary tubes to test the influence of resource density, competitor density and their statistical interaction on movement parameters. Four treatments contrasted opposing levels of algae (resource) and conspecific density in a 2 {\texttimes} 2 factorial design. Our results indicate that density- and resource-dependent behaviours act through different mechanisms to shape patterns of rotifer movement. Turn frequency increased up to twofold in resource-rich treatments, depending on the presence or absence of competitors. In contrast, swimming speed was 50\% greater in the presence of competitors under all treatments, but was only slightly depressed by the presence of resources alone. We show how these two different movement mechanisms may be integrated into predictions of consumer population spread as resource and competitor densities vary. We discuss implications of the contrasting and complementary nature of these different movement mechanisms and their possible adaptations to different environmental stimuli.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a Bayesian methodology to estimate fishing mortality rates and transoceanic migration rates of highly migratory pelagic fishes that integrates multiple sources of tagging data and auxiliary information from prior knowledge. Exploitation rates and movement rates for Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) are estimated by fitting a spatially structured model to three types of data obtained from pop-up satellite, archival, and conventional tags for the period 1990--2006 in the western North Atlantic. A sequential Bayesian statistical approach is applied in which the key components of the model are separated and fitted sequentially to data sets pertinent to each component with the posterior probability density function (pdf) of parameters from one analysis serving as the prior pdf for the next. The approach sequentially updates the estimates of age-specific fishing mortality rates (F) and transoceanic movement rates (T). Estimates of recent F are higher than the estimated rate of natural mortality and higher in the east than in the west. Estimates of annual T from the west to the east are higher for larger fish (6\% for ages 0--3 to 16\% for ages 9+). These estimates are also higher than those obtained from tagging studies before the 1990s and could be associated with changes in stock composition.},

  abstract = {Conspecific density dependence (CDD) in plant populations is widespread, most likely caused by local-scale biotic interactions, and has potentially important implications for biodiversity, community composition, and ecosystem processes. However, progress in this important area of ecology has been hindered by differing viewpoints on CDD across subfields in ecology, lack of synthesis across CDD-related frameworks, and misunderstandings about how empirical measurements of local CDD fit within the context of broader ecological theories on community assembly and diversity maintenance. Here, we propose a conceptual synthesis of local-scale CDD and its causes, including species-specific antagonistic and mutualistic interactions. First, we compare and clarify different uses of CDD and related concepts across subfields within ecology. We suggest the use of local stabilizing/destabilizing CDD to refer to the scenario where local conspecific density effects are more negative/positive than heterospecific effects. Second, we discuss different mechanisms for local stabilizing and destabilizing CDD, how those mechanisms are interrelated, and how they cut across several fields of study within ecology. Third, we place local stabilizing/destabilizing CDD within the context of broader ecological theories and discuss implications and challenges related to scaling up the effects of local CDD on populations, communities, and metacommunities. The ultimate goal of this synthesis is to provide a conceptual roadmap for researchers studying local CDD and its implications for population and community dynamics.},

We use an example with young-of-year (YOY) Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reintroductions to determine whether trophic niche overlaps and abundances limit restoration success. Using seasonal stable isotopes and abundance estimates for invertivorous fishes in three Lake Ontario tributaries, we assessed community isotopic structure, trophic niche overlap, and the impact of the niche overlap by incorporating relative abundance. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) YOY could be a strong competitor with a high trophic niche overlap with Atlantic salmon YOY, but at lower abundances relative to Atlantic salmon there is minimal impact. Stream resident fish communities appeared to partition resources across seasons such that abundant species had low trophic niche overlap to minimize overall competition with Atlantic salmon YOY given available resources, indicating niche complementarity. Through joint consideration of trophic overlap and abundance using our conceptual model, the competitive impact of community composition on a reintroduced species could be assessed.},

  abstract = {Decisions to disperse from a habitat stand out among organismal behaviours as pivotal drivers of ecosystem dynamics across scales. Encounters with other species are an important component of adaptive decision-making in dispersal, resulting in widespread behaviours like tracking resources or avoiding consumers in space. Despite this, metacommunity models often treat dispersal as a function of intraspecific density alone. We show, focusing initially on three-species network motifs, that interspecific dispersal rules generally drive a transition in metacommunities from homogeneous steady states to self-organized heterogeneous spatial patterns. However, when ecologically realistic constraints reflecting adaptive behaviours are imposed---prey tracking and predator avoidance---a pronounced homogenizing effect emerges where spatial pattern formation is suppressed. We demonstrate this effect for each motif by computing master stability functions that separate the contributions of local and spatial interactions to pattern formation. We extend this result to species-rich food webs using a random matrix approach, where we find that eventually, webs become large enough to override the homogenizing effect of adaptive dispersal behaviours, leading once again to predominately pattern-forming dynamics. Our results emphasize the critical role of interspecific dispersal rules in shaping spatial patterns across landscapes, highlighting the need to incorporate adaptive behavioural constraints in efforts to link local species interactions and metacommunity structure.

Shifts in trophic role induced by fragmentation, especially of abundant top predators, could have transcendent impacts on food web architecture and stability, as well as ecosystem function. Here we use a novel measure of trophic niche width, based on stable isotope ratios, to assess effects of aquatic ecosystem fragmentation on trophic ecology of a resilient, dominant, top predator. We demonstrate collapse in trophic niche width of the predator in fragmented systems, a phenomenon related to significant reductions in diversity of potential prey taxa. Collapsed niche width reflects a homogenization of energy flow pathways to top predators, likely serving to destabilize remnant food webs and render apparently resilient top predators more susceptible to extinction through time.},

We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is caused by higher productivity at higher diversity (the ``overyielding'' effect), competitive interactions (the ``covariance'' effect), and statistical averaging (the ``portfolio'' effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversity-stability debate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability.},

Here, we propose that evolution might commonly alter both local and regional processes of community assembly. We show how adaptation can substantially affect community assembly and that these effects depend on regional (metacommunity) factors, including environmental heterogeneity and its spatial structure. In particular, early colonists can often arrive from a nearby community, adapt to local conditions, and subsequently alter the establishment or abundance of late-arriving species, often producing an evolutionary priority effect. We also discuss how interaction type and relative rates of colonization, evolution, and community interactions determine divergent community outcomes. We describe new conceptual approaches that provide insights into these dynamics and statistical methods that can better evaluate their importance. Overall, we demonstrate that accounting for adaptation during community assembly opens up novel ways for making progress on fundamental questions in community ecology.},

These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

Green sunfish also occurred in all second- and third-order streams surveyed, but they never dominated the fish community by numbers or weight in those situations. When green sunfish were removed from three first-order streams, most native species increased in numbers and biomass; in two streams the increase more than made up (within 2 years) the biomass that had been lost by removing green sunfish.

Proportions of omnivores, insectivorous cyprinids, and herbivore-detritivores yielded inconsistent results due to confounding interactions with species tolerance, whereas alternative trophic metrics, the proportions of specialist insectivores and generalist feeders, produced consistent trends with increasing stream degradation.

The coexistence of species in invaded habitats depends on the relative strength of intra- versus inter-specific competition, where inter-specific competition from invasive to native species is often stronger than intra-specific competition, jeopardising their coexistence. In this study, we conducted a laboratory experiment to test for the relative strength of interference competition between native plains topminnow (Fundulus sciadicus) and invasive western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) at three experimental temperatures. Intra- and inter-specific competition was quantified using an isodar approach, which assumes that animals are ideally distributed to maximise their fitness. Thus, their distributions measure the quality and quantity of habitat patches. This was supplemented by behavioural observations of intra- and inter-specific competition. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find evidence that competition was asymmetrical from the invasive mosquitofish to the native plains topminnow. Instead, more individuals occupied their shared preferred habitat (a slow-moving pool) in sympatry compared to allopatry, and the isodar analysis demonstrated that intra-specific interference competition was significantly stronger than inter-specific competition at all temperature levels. Behavioural observations corroborated this analysis of habitat selection that aggression was most frequent among plains topminnow in sympatry. This study shows that the widely perceived aggression of adults might not be the only key mechanism of global invasion success by mosquitofish. Other ecological traits, such as rapid reproduction, environmental tolerance, and interactions with early life stages of native species, might also be responsible for their invasion success. Additional investigations are warranted to determine whether their invasions directly affect native species or they invade degraded ecosystems opportunistically.},

These streams are of particular interest since they support populations of spotted bass and other game fishes. The present work considers the fish population of the headwaters of one of these stream systems, the Clear Creek drainage. This system includes about 15 miles of stream, made up of Clear Creek proper and its major tributary, Hutchins' Creek. With the exception of periods of excessive rainfall, the headwaters of the streams are in the form of pools 100 to 200 feet long separated by riffles and shallows 50 to 1,000 feet in length and ranging in width from 6 to 20 feet. Pool depths range up to 5 feet. The pools were sampled by means of an electrofishing device at selected sampling stations located at intervals of about 1 mile or less. A sample consisted of the majority of the fish from a large pool along with those of the adjoining riffles. Analysis of the populations included consideration of species composition, size composition, and determination of rate of growth and coefficient of condition where possible. Twenty-three species of fish were taken from the headwaters of the two streams. The principal species included: longear sunfish, Lepomis megalotis (Rafinesque); green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus (Rafinesque); spotted bass, Micropterus punctulatus (Rafinesque); stoneroller, Campostoma anomalum (Rafinesque); bluntnose minnow, Hyborhynchus notatus (Rafinesque); creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus (Mitchill); golden redhorse, Moxostoma erythrurum (Rafinesque); white sucker, Catostomus commersoni (Lac{\'e}p{\`e}de); rainbow darter, Poecilichthys caeruleus (Storer); and madtom, Schilbeodes insignis (Richardson). The stoneroller was by far the most abundant fish. The longear and green sunfish were common enough to furnish some fishing. The spotted bass was very scarce although it is known to be present in larger numbers in these waters in the spring. The population of green and longear sunfish included a surprisingly large number of larger fish. It was concluded that heavy predation on younger fishes probably accounted for this unusual size distribution.},

  abstract = {Species in transformed habitats, frequently labelled as environmental generalists, tend to show broader niches than species in natural habitats. However, how population niche expansion translates into changes in the niches of individual organisms remains unclear, particularly in the context of habitat transformation. Niche expansion could be a product of individuals having broader niches, greater distances among individuals' niches, or a combination of both processes. This would challenge the traditional conceptions on niche dynamics, which emphasize the role played by individual specialization (IS). Here, using stable isotopes, we computed total niche width (TNW), its within- and between-individual components (WIC \&amp; BIC), and IS (the ratio WIC/TNW), in 13 populations of 6 bird species and 8 populations of 3 frog species in natural and transformed habitats. We confirmed that species had broader niche width in transformed than in natural habitats, yet population niche expansion across habitats was mainly a product of increased distance between individuals. Within each habitat type, increases in TNW were linked to increases in WIC for all habitat types, while relationships between TNW and BIC were found in transformed but not in natural habitats. Hence, both increased individual niche width and increased distance among individuals were apparent within habitats, particularly in transformed ones, where increases in WIC dominated. Neither across or within habitats was niche expansion associated with increasing IS. Therefore, our results overturn traditional conceptions associated with the niche variation hypothesis and illustrate that niche expansion is not invariably associated with increased IS, because the distance between individual's niches (BIC) can increase, as well as the breadth of those niches (WIC).},

A lack of clear consensus about the importance of allochthonous (terrestrial) organic carbon is sometimes attributed to uncertainties associated with conventional `bulk' isotope data, the most widely used ecological tracer. Amino acid-specific isotope analysis is an emerging research method promising to address existing limitations of bulk C and N isotope analyses. We tested the efficacy of amino acid {$\delta$}13C data as a generalizable measure of allochthony by analysing an aggregated dataset (n = 168) of primary and secondary data of carbon sources from disparate geographical locations across the globe. We found the {$\delta$}13C fingerprints amino acids to be consistently distinct between allochthonous (terrestrial) and autochthonous (aquatic) carbon sources. We also found that our approach is most effective when we use only essential amino acid tracers (i.e. isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, threonine and valine). Predictive trends in {$\delta$}13C fingerprints appear to be largely compatible across studies and/or laboratories. As a case study, we used this approach to quantify the contribution of terrestrial carbon to an endemic cavefish, Cryptotora thamicola, and found that its biomass was comprised largely of autochthonous carbon ( 75\%).},

Total variation among the deep-water assemblages (11 species, 86\% turnover across gill net samples) was greater than for shallow-margins (38 species, 64\% turnover across seine samples). For both shallow-margin and deep-water assemblages, variation was greater among sites than between winter and summer seasons. Shallow-margin assemblage structure was related to depth, velocity and substrate, whereas for deep-water assemblages river discharge, temperature and velocity were important. Season itself accounted for little of the variation among either shallow (6.7\%) or deep-water (2.3\%) assemblages. Overall temporal patterns of shallow-margin samples appeared to show responses to juvenile recruitment, spates and migration of coastal fishes, whereas for deep-water samples, patterns related to use of reproductive habitats, juvenile recruitment and seasonal activity levels. Brazos River assemblages were less variable overall in comparison with studies along similar length of reach in headwater streams and wadeable rivers. The residual variation in species distribution (54\% for shallow-margin and 67\% for deepwater) that was not explained by instream variables and season suggests a greater influence of biotic interactions in rivers, particularly those across the spatially dynamic interface of main channel habitats and shallow river margins.},

  abstract = {Conservation and management of organic carbon (OC) pools in aquatic regions are vital for enhancing carbon sequestration. However, whether the influence of nutrient-driven dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition on OC dynamics is convergent or divergent across aquatic systems remains unclear. This study selected 124 sediment sites from rivers, reservoirs, and offshore areas to investigate the relationships between DOM components, OC fractions, and environmental parameters. OC pools from different aquatic regions have similar distributions, with particulate OC (POC) and mineral-associated OC (MAOC) accounting for 90~\% of the total OC pool. DOM's sources and compositions differ in those aquatic ecosystems. In rivers and reservoirs, DOM mainly comes from allochthonous inputs, demonstrating a high degree of humification and a large molecular weight. Offshore DOM is characterized by a smaller molecular weight and lower humification; it receives inputs from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources, with the latter predominating. DOM composition (66.81~\%) and environmental parameters (33.19~\%) jointly regulate OC pool dynamics across aquatic regions, with DOM composition being the key influencing factor. Specifically, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen affect autochthonous DOM, which in turn influences MAOC distribution. By contrast, allochthonous DOM is only influenced by phosphorus forms and contributes to increased POC. Compared with allochthonous DOM, autochthonous DOM has a greater effect on sediment OC. These findings emphasize the importance of ``multisource'' carbon management for sustaining OC sinks in aquatic environments and providing a theoretical framework for optimizing carbon-neutral development.},

Self-organized spatial patterns are important determinants of the functioning of ecosystems, promoting the growth and survival of the involved organisms, and affecting the capacity of the organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions. The predominant explanation for self-organized pattern formation is spatial heterogeneity in establishment, growth and mortality, resulting from the self-organization processes. A number of recent studies, however, have revealed that movement of organisms can be an important driving process creating extensive spatial patterning in many ecosystems. Here, we review studies that detail movement-based pattern formation in contrasting ecological settings. Our review highlights that a common principle, where movement of organisms is density-dependent, explains observed spatial regular patterns in all of these studies. This principle, well known to physics as the Cahn--Hilliard principle of phase separation, has so-far remained unrecognized as a general mechanism for self-organized complexity in ecology. Using the examples presented in this paper, we explain how this movement principle can be discerned in ecological settings, and clarify how to test this mechanism experimentally. Our study highlights that animal movement, both in isolation and in unison with other processes, is an important mechanism for regular pattern formation in ecosystems.},

Juvenile and adult smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui were nearly ubiquitous in the habitats of the study area, although densities were highest among snags. Minnows and darters used shallower areas, but the range of velocity used differed among species and life stages. Vegetated and channel edge habitats served as nursery areas. Total fish densities were highest in edge pool, backwaters, snags, edge riffles, and riffles.

Classic ecological theory1,2 posits that niches dictate the maximum number of species that can coexist in a community and that the richness of observed species will be below this maximum only where immigration is very low. A new alternative theory3,4 is that niches, instead, dictate the minimum number of coexisting species and that the richness of observed species will usually be well above this because of ongoing immigration. We conducted an experimental test to discriminate between these two unified theories using a manipulative field experiment with tropical intertidal communities. We found, consistent with the new theory, that the relationship of species richness to immigration rate stabilized at a low value at low immigration rates and did not saturate at high immigration rates. Our results suggest that tropical intertidal communities have low niche diversity and are typically in a dispersal-assembled regime where immigration is high enough to overfill the niches. Observational data from other studies3,5 suggest that these conclusions may generalize to other ecological systems. Our new experimental approach can be adapted for other systems and be used as a `niche detector' and a tool for assessing when communities are niche versus dispersal assembled.},

  abstract = {Dispersal can strongly influence local population dynamics and may be critical to species persistence in fragmented landscapes. Theory predicts that dispersal by resident stream organisms is necessary to offset the loss of individuals to downstream drift. However, there is a lack of empirical data linking dispersal and drift to local population dynamics in streams, leading to uncertainty regarding the general demographic significance of these processes and the power of drift to explain observed dispersal patterns. I assessed the contribution of dispersal along a first-order stream to population dynamics of the headwater salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae). I conducted mark--recapture surveys of two contiguous 500 m long sections of a study stream in June, July, and August of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Movement by G. porphyriticus larvae and adults showed a strong upstream bias in the study stream, as well as in 11 other streams that I surveyed. Using mark--recapture models and Akaike's information criterion for model selection, monthly probability of dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section of the study stream (mean {\textpm} 1 se) was estimated to be 0.02 {\textpm} 0.01. The probability of dispersal from the upstream section to the downstream section was 0.00 {\textpm} 0.00. Monthly survival probabilities did not differ between sections. Estimated monthly population growth rates were 1.01 {\textpm} 0.01 in both sections. Net dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section contributed to the equality of population growth rates. Additionally, reproduction and individual condition were lower in the upstream section, suggesting that population stability and growth there (i.e., {$\lambda$} {$\geq$} 1.0) may have been dependent on immigration from downstream. Similar interactions between dispersal and variation in local demographic rates along the stream continuum may underlie the distribution and abundance patterns of other organisms at multiple spatial scales. Greater empirical understanding of these interactions will improve conservation of stream biota. The strong upstream bias of G. porphyriticus movement suggests that dispersal is not a response to downstream drift. I propose an alternative model for the evolution of directionally biased dispersal based on the landscape-scale distribution of headwater habitats.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated the widespread existence of spatio-temporal variations in the abundance and distribution of species of freshwater fishes, previously assumed not to move between habitats. These movements are often on a seasonal or ontogenetic basis, for spawning, feeding and refuge, and in many cases are fundamental for the successful completion of lifecycles. This important book provides a single source for a range of previously widely dispersed information on these movements of fish in fresh waters, covering potamodromous fishes as well as the more familiar diadromous species, worldwide. Contents include full descriptions of types of migration and spatial behaviour, the stimulus and capacity for fish to migrate, the effects of climate on patterns of migratory behaviour, a taxonomic analysis (mostly by family) of freshwater fish migration, methods for studying migration, and details of the impacts of man's activities on freshwater fish migration. Migration of Freshwater Fishes provides an excellent and comprehensive reference to which the river manager, biologist or student can now refer to obtain information, advice and current opinion on the migratory behaviour of most taxonomic groups of fishes occurring in fresh water. University libraries and aquatic research stations should also have copies of this essential reference book on their shelves.  Well-known international authors. Of great commercial importance to fisheries and professional angling bodies. Draws together much new information in one place. Detailed review of world wide migratory behaviour for most groups of freshwater fishes. Pure and applied relevance, for academics, fisheries scientists, river managers and conservationists.

To provide information on the movements and localized activity of barbel Barbus barbus (Cyprinidae) in a river containing potentially obstructing weirs, 31 adult barbel were radio-tracked in the River Nidd, a tributary of the Yorkshire Ouse, North East England between June 1993 and September 1994. 2. Barbel exhibited substantial movements, ranging from 2 to nearly 20 km. Four fish are known to have moved between the Nidd and the Ouse, demonstrating that at least a part of the barbel population utilize the Nidd and Ouse at different times of the year. 3. Range of upstream movement was restricted by the presence and nature of several weirs, including Skip Bridge flow-gauging weir. Low levels of spawning downstream of Skip Bridge weir appear to have been due to a lack of suitable spawning habitat. 4. Movements followed a seasonal pattern, with males and females migrating upstream in spring to spawn on gravel beds. Females moved downstream more quickly than males over the summer months. Both sexes moved downstream in autumn and winter. Day length and water temperature were the best predictors in relation to distance moved up the River Nidd. Descriptive models, relating movement to water temperature and day length, are provided. 5. For both sexes, localized activity varied greatly on both diel and seasonal scales, and was mainly associated with foraging. During summer there was typically a bimodal pattern of diel activity with peaks usually in early morning and late evening. In winter, mean daily activity was less than 20\% of peak summer levels and fish were relatively dormant. In winter, diel activity patterns exhibited a single peak towards dusk. Mean daily activity levels for each month were linearly correlated with mean monthly water temperatures, even during the months where movement to and on the spawning sites occurred. 6. The importance of natural migrations and seasonal activity patterns for barbel, and likewise many other riverine cyprinids, has probably been underestimated for a wide variety of river systems. As major components of riverine fish communities, the importance of seasonal movements of mobile cyprinid species should be considered when constructing weirs and other obstructions. Greater consideration should be given to ways of mitigating effects of existing barriers to movement of non-salmonid species.},

The text presents complete coverage of all the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction, missing data, model criticism, and prior sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked examples and a wide range of applications from various disciplines.  The book introduces regression models, techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide range of modelling issues before going into the vital area of hierarchical models, one of the most common applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative priors, and thoughtful choice of prior distributions---all those aspects of the "art" of modelling that are easily overlooked in more theoretical expositions.   More pragmatic than ideological, the authors systematically work through the large range of "tricks" that reveal the real power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction, ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the examples are biostatistical, but they do not require domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range of other application areas.

  abstract = {1. This study analysed changes occurring in Mediterranean stream fish assemblages over a sequence of dry years followed by a generally wet period (1991--98). Variations in assemblage attributes were quantified at the basin and stream reach scales, and related to variables reflecting the occurrence of unusually dry or wet conditions. 2. Assemblage variability increased along with the resolution of analysis, with little changes in species richness, composition and rank abundances, but significant variation in individual species abundances. Fluctuations in relative abundances were significantly affected by variables reflecting the severity of summer droughts and the occurrence of rainy springs. These patterns were evident at the basin scale, while variability at individual stream reaches tended to be higher and less related to rainfall patterns. 3. At least three response guilds to rainfall variation could be identified: two of the four abundant and widespread species (chub and loach) declined following dry years, whereas the two other core species (nase and eel) declined after rainy spring; one scarce native species (stickleback) increased in dry years. 4. Except at the two most upstream reaches, the assemblages tended to recover quickly to previous configuration after the changes occurring during the sequence of dry years. 5. Temporal variability of local assemblages was concordant among reaches but did not follow any consistent spatial pattern. Instead, spatial patterns in assemblage attributes changed over time in response to environmental variability, with a tendency for a disruption of upstream--downstream gradients following dry years. 6. Results supported the view that present-day droughts cause relatively small and transient changes to Mediterranean stream fish assemblages. However, longer and more severe droughts expected under altered future climates, may result in declines or local extinctions of the most sensitive species and their potential replacement by more resistant species. Changing drought regimes thus need to be duly considered in the development of conservation strategies for Mediterranean stream fish.},

  abstract = {Networks of direct and indirect biotic interactions underpin the complex dynamics and stability of ecological systems, yet experimental and theoretical studies often yield conflicting evidence regarding the direction (positive or negative) or magnitude of these interactions. We revisited pioneering data sets collected at the deciduous forested Horonai Stream and conducted ecosystem-level syntheses to demonstrate that the direction of direct and indirect interactions can change depending on the timescale of observation. Prior experimental studies showed that terrestrial prey that enter the stream from the adjacent forest caused positive indirect effects on aquatic invertebrates during summer by diverting fish consumption. Seasonal and annual estimates of secondary production and organic matter flows along food web pathways demonstrate that this seasonal input of terrestrial invertebrate prey increases production of certain fish species, reversing the indirect effect on aquatic invertebrates from positive at the seasonal timescale to negative at the annual timescale. Even though terrestrial invertebrate prey contributed 54\% of the annual organic matter flux to fishes, primarily during summer, fish still consumed 98\% of the aquatic invertebrate annual production, leading to top-down control that is not revealed in short-term experiments and demonstrating that aquatic prey may be a limiting resource for fishes. Changes in the direction or magnitude of interactions may be a key factor creating nonlinear or stabilizing feedbacks in complex systems, and these dynamics can be revealed by merging experimental and comparative approaches at different scales.},

This rewiring can significantly affect how ecosystems function. To better predict the future structure of ecological networks, assessing their ability to adapt to changes is crucial. Here, we introduce two concepts: `rewiring capacity' of a single species (the multidimensional trait space of all its potential interaction partners within a region) and `rewiring potential' of a local community (the total trait space covered by interaction partners of the species at the target trophic level locally). To quantify the rewiring capacity and potential, we apply existing methods for determining species' functional interaction niches in a novel way to assess species' and communities' ability to form new interactions and the functional resilience of interaction networks to global change. To illustrate the applicability of these concepts, we quantified the rewiring capacity and potential of interactions between 1002 flowering plant species and 318 hummingbird species across the Americas. The rewiring capacity and potential metrics offer a new way to understand and quantify network resilience, allowing us to map how ecological networks respond to global change.},

Among the tools used to assess resource use, stable isotope analysis has proliferated in ecological studies, particularly in relation to describing intra- and interspecific variation in trophic interactions. Despite a growing need to disseminate scientific information, the inherent limitations of stable isotope ratios and inappropriate synonymizing of distinct evolutionary and ecological processes may mislead ecological inferences in natural systems. This situation necessitates a re-evaluation of the utility of stable isotope ratios to address certain ecological questions. Here, we assess the efficacy of stable isotope ratios to describe two fundamental ecological processes, niche partitioning and individual specialization. Investigation of these processes has increased substantially in accordance with increased access to stable isotope data. This article discusses the circumstances and approaches that are necessary to evaluate niche partitioning and individual specialization, and outlines key considerations for the associated application of stable isotope ratios.},

  abstract = {Rationale Stable isotope ratios ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values) provide a unique perspective into the ecology of animals because the isotope ratio values of consumers reflect the values in food. Despite the value of stable isotopes in ecological studies, the lack of species-specific experimentally derived diet-tissue discrimination factors (DTDFs) and turnover rates limits their application at a broad scale. Furthermore, most aquatic feeding experiments use temperate, fast-growing fish species and few have considered medium- to large-sized adults with low growth rates from tropical ecosystems. Methods A controlled-diet stable isotope feeding trial was conducted over a 196-day period for the adult predatory reef fish leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus). This study calculated {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N DTDFs and turnover rates in five tissues (liver, plasma, red blood cells (RBC), fin, and muscle) using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped with an elemental analyzer. In addition, the effect of chemical lipid extraction (LE) on stable isotope values was examined for each tissue. Results Turnover was mainly influenced by metabolism (as opposed to growth) with LE {$\delta$}15N half-life values lowest in fin (37 days) and plasma (66 days), and highest in RBC (88 days) and muscle (126 days). The diet-tissue discrimination factors for {$\delta$}15N values in all tissues ({$\Delta$}15N: --0.15 to 1.84‰) were typically lower than commonly reported literature values. Lipid extraction altered both {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C values compared with untreated samples; however, for the {$\delta$}15N values, the differences were small (mean {$\delta$}15NLE-Bulk {$<$}0.46‰ in all tissues). Conclusions This study informs future interpretation of stable isotope data for medium- to large-sized fish and demonstrates that DTDFs developed for temperate fish species, particularly for {$\delta$}15N values, may not apply to tropical species. Sampling of muscle and/or RBC is recommended for a relatively long-term representation of feeding habits, while plasma and/or fin should be used for a more recent indication of diet.

We briefly review the history of theoretical and empirical perspectives on community change, and propose a new framework for viewing temporal trajectories of communities in multivariate space. We used a stream fish dataset spanning 40~years (1969--2008) in southern Oklahoma, USA, emphasizing our own 1981--2008 collections which included well-documented, extreme drought and flood events, to assess dynamics of and environmental factors affecting the fish community. We evaluated the trajectory of the Brier Creek community in multivariate space relative to trajectories in 27 published studies, and for Brier Creek fish, tested hypotheses about gradual versus event-driven changes and persistence of shifts to alternate states. Most species were persistent, qualitatively, across the four decades, but varied widely in abundance, with some having unusually strong reproduction after extreme droughts. The community had an early period of relatively gradual and directional change, but greater displacement than predicted at random after two consecutive extreme droughts midway through the study (1998 and 2000). But, the community subsequently returned toward its former state in the last decade. This fish community is characterized by species that are tolerant of environmental extremes, and have life history traits that facilitate population recovery. The community appears ``loosely stable'' about a long-term average condition, but the impacts of the two consecutive droughts were substantial, and may foretell future dynamics of this or other communities in a changed global climate if disturbance events become more frequent or severe.},

The fauna of the stream was dominated numerically by minnows (Cyprinidae), sunfish and black bass (Centrarchidae), and topminnows (Fundulidae). The pool fish fauna of the total 1 km reach (including all 14 pools) was highly consistent throughout the study, despite two major floods. Assemblages in individual pools generally were consistent, but there was more variation within pools than at the scale of the entire reach. Throughout the study, most individual pools remained within discrete subsets of the total occupied multivariate space in a principal components analysis based on fish species abundances. Sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) and bass (Micropterus spp.) were more consistent in their distribution among pools than were minnows (Cyprinidae) or a topminnow (Fundulus). There were 25 significant correlations in occurrence of species pairs among stream pools, out of 91 possible comparisons of the 14 most abundant taxa in the reach. Many pools contained assemblages either dominated by large centrarchids or by abundant cyprinids and juvenile centrarchids, but intermediate assemblages also were observed. The dynamics of distribution of fish species and fish assemblages among individual stream pools are likely influenced by a combination of species-specific behaviors and habitat selection, predator constraints on use of individual pools by small fishes, riffles as size-selective barriers to fish movements between pools, dispersal of young-of-the-year fishes, and abiotic phenomena like floods. Individual stream pools appear to be discrete habitat units for fishes, and do represent an appropriate scale for biologically meaningful studies of fish assemblages or their effects on streams.},

  abstract = {Density-dependent dispersal can be caused by various mechanisms, from competition inducing individuals to emigrate (positive density-dependence) to social crowding effects impeding free movement (negative density-dependence). Various spatial population models have incorporated positively density-dependent dispersal algorithms, and recent theoretical models have explored the conditions for density-dependent dispersal (DD) to evolve. However, while the existence of DD is well documented in some taxa such as insects, there is no clear picture on its generality in vertebrates. Here I review the available empirical data on DD in birds and mammals, focusing mainly on variation in dispersal between years and on experimental density manipulations. Surprisingly few studies have explicitly focused on DD, and interpretation of the available data is often hampered by differences in approach, small sample sizes and/or statistical shortcomings. Positive DD was reported in 50 and 33\% of the selected mammal and bird studies, respectively, while two studies on mammals (out of eight) reported negative DD. Among bird studies, DD was more often reported for emigration rates or long-distance recoveries than for average distances within finite study areas. Experimental studies manipulating densities (mainly on mammals) have consistently generated positive DD, typically showing reduced emigration in response to partial population removal. Studies that examined dispersal in relation to seasonal changes in density (small mammals only) have more often reported negative DD. Studies that compared dispersal between sites differing in density, also show a mixture of positive and negative DD. This suggests that dispersal changes in a more complex way with seasonal and spatial density variation than with annual densities, and/or that these results are confounded by other factors differing between seasons and sites, such as habitat quality. I conclude that both correlational and experimental studies support the existence of positive, rather than negative, density-dependent dispersal in birds and mammals.},

Displacement distance of each species were presented and discussed considering seasonal (rainy and dry) and body size patterns. We marked 10 species along the stream and recaptured 440 (34.6\%) of the 1,270 marked fishes. The species with significant number of upstream moving individuals were Astyanax janeiroensis, Characidium interruptum, Astyanax hastatus, Parotocinclus maculicauda and Awaous tajasica. Only Pimelodella lateristriga presented significant differences between resident and moving individuals. Characidium interruptum and A. tajasica demonstrated greater downstream and upstream movement, respectively, moving up to 2,100 m. Even after controlling for species identity we found no significant correlation between fish length and individual displacement distance. Fishes moved longer distances during the rainy season, in accordance to the breeding season. Patterns of fish movement were in agreement to life-history traits of many of the studied species and can be reflecting specific behaviour and morphologies.},

The models are parameterized using allometric relationships specific to four fish life history strategies, constraining the model to biologically plausible regions in parameter space. Using a coupled consumer-resource competition model, I get the paradoxical result that two populations can coexist in equilibrium on an identical resource base, without recourse to temporal or spatial partitioning. In contrast to much theory on limiting similarity, the model also predicts that fish populations of similar life history strategies can coexist in equilibrium with complete resource overlap. This form of coexistence (called density-dependent coexistence) requires that life history strategies differ such that an advantage at one stage of the life cycle implies a disadvantage at another stage in the life cycle. These exact life history trade-offs appear in small-bodied fish. Furthermore, it is postulated that this result may be applicable to other taxa.},

Utah Chub were first documented in the lake in 1993 and have become abundant over the past two decades. Little is known about the ecology of UTC, but they typically have negative effects on salmonids in systems where they have been introduced. We sought to fill knowledge gaps in UTC ecology and provide insight on potential interactions with Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (YCT) Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri. Ninety-four YCT and 95 UTC were radio-tagged in spring 2019 and 2020 to better understand potential interactions between YCT and UTC in Henrys Lake. Fish were located via mobile tracking and fixed receivers from June to December 2019 and 2020. In June of both years, YCT and UTC were concentrated in nearshore habitats. As water temperatures increased, UTC were documented in deeper water (mean {\textpm} SD = 3.6 {\textpm} 1.4 m) and YCT became more concentrated in areas with cold water (e.g., mouths of tributaries, in-lake springs). In July and August, large congregations of UTC were observed. Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout were detected in tributaries from June to August, but no UTC were detected in the tributaries. By late fall (November--December), YCT were located along the shoreline and UTC were detected in the middle of the lake. Both YCT and UTC were observed in areas with dense vegetation. Macrophytes likely provided a food source for UTC and cover from predators for both species. Locations of YCT were negatively related to warm water temperatures, whereas UTC were positively associated with warm water temperatures. Results from this research fill knowledge gaps in UTC and YCT interactions as well as provide valuable insight on the ecology of UTC and adfluvial Cutthroat Trout populations. Furthermore, distribution patterns and habitat selectivity of YCT and UTC in Henrys Lake can be used to inform management decisions for fishery improvement and YCT conservation.},

Of the total wadeable perennial stream length in the region 38\% was fair and 14\% was poor. There were insufficient data to calculate IBIs for 21\% of the wadeable stream length in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands; all of these streams were small (watershed area {$\leq$}2 km2) and lacked sufficient sample size ({$<$}10 individuals) to calculate an IBI.},

Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.},

  abstract = {A variety of movements characterize the behavioral plasticity of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in fresh water, including movements of fry from redds, establishment of feeding territories, spawning movements of sexually mature male parr, movement to and from winter habitat, and smolt migration in spring. Smolting is an adaptive specialization for downstream migration, seawater entry, and marine residence. While still in fresh water, smolts become silvery and streamlined, lose their positive rheotaxis and territoriality, and begin schooling. Physiological changes include increased salinity tolerance, olfactory sensitivity, metabolic rate, scope for growth, and altered hemoglobin and visual pigments. Through their impact on the neuroendocrine system, photoperiod and temperature regulate physiological changes, whereas temperature and water flow may initiate migration. Smolt survival is affected by a limited period of readiness (a physiological "smolt window") and the timing of seawater entry with environmental conditions such as temperature, food, and predators (an ecological "smolt window"). Smolt development is adversely affected by acidity, pollutants, and improper rearing conditions, and is often more sensitive than other life stages. Unfortunately, the migration corridor of smolts (mainstems of rivers and estuaries) are the most heavily impacted by pollution, dams, and other anthropogenic activities that may be directly lethal or increase mortality by delaying or inhibiting smolt migration.}

Turnover was estimated from the dilution of a 15N label introduced into consumer tissues by feeding on 15N-enriched periphyton. Muscle turnover rates were rapid (0.5--3.8\% per day), and were attributable to metabolic replacement of N as well as growth in catfish and snails. N turnover in catfish muscle decreased with size, and fin tissue turned over more rapidly than whole blood or muscle, though the difference was not significant. Our results indicate that stable isotope signatures of these tropical species could change markedly within weeks following a shift in diet. However, generalization across taxa or latitudes is complicated by the strong size-dependence of isotope turnover rates. The enrichment-dilution approach outlined here may facilitate measurement of isotopic turnover in a wide variety of consumers under field conditions.},

A modification of Sale's habitat selection model provides a conceptual linkage for relating resource availability and individual habitat selection to exploratory behaviour, emigration and population-level responses. Whole-population experiments with pupfish Cyprinodon macularius that linked all factors along this resource to population continuum lend support to this conceptual model, and illustrate that emigration may be much more common in fish populations than considered in most individual- or population-based models. Accommodating emigration can enhance the ecological appropriateness of behavioural experiments and increase confidence in extrapolation of experimental observations to population-level effects. New experimental designs and advancing technologies offer avenues for assessing population consequences of habitat selection and emigration by individual fish. Emigration often is the key linkage between individual behaviour and population responses, and greater understanding of the underlying factors affecting this often-overlooked demographic parameter could offer new approaches for management and conservation of fishes.},

Coexistence in Ecology examines the major features of these mechanisms for species that coexist at different positions in complex food webs, and derives empirical tests from model predictions.Exploring the various challenges species face, Mark McPeek systematically builds a model food web, beginning with an ecosystem devoid of life and then adding one species at a time. With the introduction of each new species, he evaluates the properties it must possess to invade a community and quantifies the changes in the abundances of other species that result from a successful invasion. McPeek continues this process until he achieves a multitrophic level food web with many species coexisting at each trophic level, from omnivores, mutualists, and pathogens to herbivores, carnivores, and basic plants. He then describes the observational and experimental empirical studies that can test the theoretical predictions resulting from the model analyses.Synthesizing decades of theoretical research in community ecology, Coexistence in Ecology offers new perspectives on how to develop an empirical program of study rooted in the natural histories of species and the mechanisms by which they actually interact with one another.},

We know from much previous work that dispersal can cause such abundance distortions. However, almost all previous theoretical studies have only considered one species alone or two interacting species (e.g. competitors or predator and prey). Moreover, a systematic analysis is needed of whether different dispersal strategies (e.g. passive dispersal versus demographic habitat selection) result in different abundance distortion patterns, how these distortion patterns change with local food web structure, and how the dispersal propensities of the interacting species might evolve in response to one another. In this article, we show using computer simulations and analytical models that abundance distortions occur in simple food webs with both passive dispersal and habitat selection, but habitat selection causes larger distortions. Additionally, patterns in the evolution of dispersal propensity in interacting species are very different for these two dispersal strategies. This study identifies that the dispersal strategies employed by interacting species critically shape how dispersal will influence metacommunity structure.

This analysis demonstrates that a guild of multiple consumers can easily coexist on a single resource if each limits its own abundance to some degree, and stronger intraspecific density dependence permits a wider variety of consumers to coexist. The mechanism permitting multiple consumers to coexist works in a fashion similar to apparent competition or to each consumer having its own specialized predator. These results argue for a more explicit emphasis on how negative intraspecific density dependence is generated and how these mechanisms combine with species interactions to shape overall community structure.},

However, populations of many freshwater fishes in the Mediterranean region are threatened by man-\-induced drought due to water diversion. Mark-\-recapture methodology is an effective tool for estimating fish abundance and survival probability, but it has been seldom used with Mediterranean freshwater fish. We tagged over 2,400 individuals of two threatened cyprinids (Mediterranean barbel Barbus meridionalis and Catalan chub Squalius laietanus) inhabiting an Iberian stream affected by water diversion, and used mark-\-recapture methods to evaluate the effects of flow, temperature and depth on their apparent survival and abundance at hydrologically altered and perennial reaches. Based on estimates over the summer drying season, survival of Mediterranean barbel was more than six times higher in an upstream reach with permanent flow than a middle reach impacted by water diversion. Water depth was the most important habitat feature accounting for differences in survival, with both barbel and chub exhibiting higher survival and abundance at permanent sites farther downstream where flow had been restored and in an unaltered tributary. Our results show clear negative impacts of water diversion on fish populations. Both species, but particularly barbel, have life-\-cycle characteristics that may allow populations to recover quickly if natural streamflow was restored by conserving water and reducing water diversion.},

Using a patch-to-patch movement analysis, we investigated predictions of how free-ranging bison (Bison bison) living in a meadow-forest matrix use memory to reduce uncertainty in energy intake rate. Results indicate that bison remembered pertinent information about location and quality of meadows, and they used this information to selectively move to meadows of higher profitability. Moreover, bison chose profitable meadows they had previously visited, and this choice was stronger after visiting a relatively poor quality meadow. Our work demonstrates a link between memory, energy gains and restricted space use while establishing a fitness-based integration of movement, cognitive and spatial ecology.},

In this setting, it is believed that the coexistence of all species requires their traits to satisfy restrictive conditions limiting their similarity. To investigate whether diverse metacommunities can assemble in a CC trade-off model, we study their assembly from a probabilistic perspective. From a pool of species with parameters (corresponding to traits) sampled at random, we compute the probability that any number of species coexist and characterize the set of species that emerges through assembly. Remarkably, almost exactly half of the species in a large pool typically coexist, with no saturation as the size of the pool grows, and with little dependence on the underlying distribution of traits. Through a mix of analytical results and simulations, we show that this unlimited niche packing emerges as assembly actively moves communities toward overdispersed configurations in niche space. Our findings also apply to a realistic assembly scenario where species invade one at a time from a fixed regional pool. When diversity arises de novo in the metacommunity, richness still grows without bound, but more slowly. Together, our results suggest that the CC trade-off can support the robust emergence of diverse communities, even when coexistence of the full species pool is exceedingly unlikely.},

Emergent coexistence has functional consequences, for example constraining community assembly and reducing robustness to extinctions. Here, we demonstrate that emergent coexistence can arise without intransitivity in competitive communities with pairwise interactions. First, we develop a simple trade-off model where interactions are competitive, transitive, and pairwise, yet coexistence is emergent. Second, we show that coexistence is typically emergent in well-known hierarchical trade-off models. Third, we find that emergent coexistence frequently occurs without pronounced intransitivity in random model communities. Our results suggest that competitive coexistence may often be emergent, highlighting a need to better understand the mechanisms and prevalence of this phenomenon in order to reliably predict community assembly, robustness, and biodiversity maintenance.},

Model parameters of prey encounter rates and prey handling times were quantified as functions of fish size, prey density, and prey size through a series of laboratory feeding experiments using the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Results of these experiments show both searching ability and prey handling efficiency to increase with increasing fish size. Predictions of prey size selection and optimal habitat use based upon maximizing energetic gain were then examined in a small Michigan lake for three size classes of bluegills. Bluegills {$>$} 100 mm standard length were highly size selective in their feeding and their diets closely matched predictions of an optimal diet model. From two estimates of relative prey visibilities I show that these fish selected larger prey items than would be predicted if prey were consumed "as encountered." Habitat use of large bluegills was also shown to maximize foraging return as fish switched from utilizing vegetation-living prey to utilizing open-water zooplankton as relative foraging profitabilities in the two habitats changed across the summer. Bluegills {$<$}100 mm standard length were restricted in their habitat use, remaining in or near the vegetation despite demonstrated increases in foraging return available in the open-water habitat. Size-related predation risk apparently accounts for differences in habitat use between bluegill size classes, and its consequences for intra- and interspecific competition between size classes are discussed.}

Through comparative and experimental studies in natural lakes, we show how variation in Daphnia size and abundance has a strong impact on adult bluegill foraging gain and growth, and how the bluegill in turn influences Daphnia abundance and size. A two---life---stage model is used to predict how natural variation in Daphnia productivity among lakes should affect both adult and juvenile bluegill densities and growth rates. The model predicts that adult bluegill growth and density should be positively correlated among lakes, while juvenile growth and density should be negatively correlated in these same lakes. These predictions arise despite density dependence acting in each life---stage. A long---term data set on bluegill growth and abundance in a series of natural lakes supports these predictions. Finally, we consider what factors might drive variation in Daphnia abundance and size structure among lakes, and suggest that the volume (and/or productivity) of the hypolimnetic refuge available to Daphnia is a key factor. The strong interaction between adult bluegill and Daphnia, coupled with the bluegill's two---stage life history, provides an important mechanism by which the dynamics of littoral species (fish and their invertebrate resources) are coupled to the dynamics of open---water zooplankton.},

The aim of the present study was to assess ecological impacts and competitive exclusion dynamics involving co-occurring introduced and native fish species, using the multiple predator functional response (FR) approach. We use comparative FR analysis (resource uptake as a function of resource density) to assess inter-specific interactions between the invasive western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis and the native freshwater river goby Glossogobius callidus towards chironomid larvae. The FR was derived for each fish species as individuals and when in heterospecific pairings. Data from single individuals were used to predict the expected FR of individuals when in heterospecific multiple predator combinations. Expected FRs were then compared to the observed FRs of each predator in combination trials, enumerated using prey items in their gut contents. Both fish species displayed Type II FRs, however, in single fish trials, invasive mosquitofish had significantly higher FRs (curve asymptotes; i.e. shorter handling times and higher maximum feeding rates) than native river gobies. Heterospecific mosquitofish-river goby combinations revealed that the FR of the river goby was reduced (i.e. longer handling times and lower maximum feeding rates) by the presence of mosquitofish, whereas this combination greatly enhanced mosquitofish FR magnitudes (i.e. shorter handling times and higher maximum feeding rates). The heterospecific treatments resulted in neutral impacts on prey and there were clear inter-species interference in favour of the non-native mosquitofish. This study demonstrates how multiple predators can alter the shape of individual FRs, with neutral effects on prey but superior invader competitive ability. This has implications for predicting the naturalisation success of invasive predators, as predatory and competitive interactions with native predators and prey may facilitate rather than impede establishment.},

  abstract = {Community assembly is affected by environmental filtering that restricts viable phenotypes and by species interactions that impose limits on interspecific trait similarity. Relative influences of these processes should vary according to habitat features and dispersal. Species dispersion within assemblage trait space also should vary in relation to species richness, strength of competition, and the spatiotemporal scale of analysis. We examined ecomorphological diversity of two freshwater fish families (Neotropical Cichlidae, Nearctic Centrarchidae) to test theories of local assembly from regional species pools and theories of species packing within mesohabitat patches. Cichlid and centrarchid assemblages were surveyed in four floodplain rivers (two in South America and two in North America) during low-water periods when fish densities are highest. Surveys were conducted in four mesohabitat types (submerged wood, leaf litter, rocks, sand bank) within river channels and floodplain lakes. We measured 23 morphological traits associated with locomotion and feeding. Principal components analysis was performed on the species {\texttimes} traits matrix, and species axis scores were used to calculate species pairwise Euclidean distances and indices of dispersion within assemblage morphospace: mean nearest-neighbor distance (indicating similarity), mean distance to centroid (assemblage morphospace size), and standard deviation of nearest-neighbor distance (evenness of dispersion within assemblage morphospace). A null model was used to assess whether patterns were significantly nonrandom. When data for all mesohabitat types were combined for each river, species were significantly overdispersed and the assemblage morphospace was larger than predicted at random in every case. Analysis of assemblages within mesohabitat patches of different types revealed, in every case, significant overdispersion of species in morphospace indicative of limiting similarity. The total assemblage morphospace was greater than expected for tropical cichlids, but not for temperate centrarchids. Trends of species dispersion with assemblage morphospace in relation to species richness within mesohabitat patches were not consistent among or within river systems, possibly indicating that patches were already saturated with these perciform fishes. Interregional comparisons suggest an influence from both adaptive diversification and environmental filtering at broad spatial scales. At the scale of mesohabitat patches in lowland rivers, cichlid and centrarchid assemblages revealed patterns of trait complementarity that imply limiting similarity and strong influence of biotic interactions.},

  abstract = {To preserve natural ecosystems and their biodiversity, there is a need to anticipate future ecosystem changes through better understanding of underlying drivers and assembly processes determining community composition. Assembly processes can be understood as a set of filters acting at different spatio-temporal scales that jointly define the structure and composition of communities. Here, we explore the underlying assembly processes shaping marine fish species distribution and composition, using the heavily exploited North Sea. Our aims are to study 1) the relative importance of the different assembly processes shaping marine fish communities, 2) the key environmental drivers determining species distributions and composition, and to 3) quantify the role of traits in determining species niches and responses to the environment. Specifically, we fit a joint species distribution model (JSDM) using 31 years of standardized scientific bottom trawl survey data for 67 fish species. We use a set of environmental variables and species' traits representing morphology, life history, reproduction and diet, while also accounting for phylogenetic relationships of species. Environmental variables, primarily related to temperature, explained over one third of the variance in species occurrence, while spatial effects explained half of the variability across species. This shows that environmental filtering and spatially-structured processes are the main drivers shaping the community assembly. Furthermore, among the total variance of individual species occurrences, 12.5\% could be explained by traits, which improve the mechanistic understanding on species responses to environmental change. Hence, model predictions from JSDMs accounting for traits, environmental niches and potential interactions among multiple species can provide relevant simulations and forecasts with the potential to inform spatial management and conservation efforts aiming to preserve biodiversity and its associated services vital for human well-being.},

  abstract = {Using geospatial data of wildlife presence to predict a species distribution across a geographic area is among the most common tools in management and conservation. The collection of high-quality presence--absence (PA) data through structured surveys is, however, expensive, and managers usually have access to larger amounts of low-quality presence-only (PO) data collected by citizen scientists, opportunistic observations and culling returns for game species. Integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have been developed to make the most of the data available by combining the higher-quality, but usually scarcer and more spatially restricted, PA data with the lower-quality, unstructured, but usually more extensive PO datasets. Joint-likelihood ISDMs can be run in a Bayesian context using integrated nested laplace approximation methods that allow the addition of a spatially structured random effect to account for data spatial autocorrelation. Here, we apply this innovative approach to fit ISDMs to empirical data, using PA and PO data for the three prevalent deer species in Ireland: red, fallow and sika deer. We collated all deer data available for the past 15 years and fitted models predicting distribution and relative abundance at a 25 km2 resolution across the island. Model predictions were associated to spatial estimate of uncertainty, allowing us to assess the quality of the model and the effect that data scarcity has on the certainty of predictions. Furthermore, we checked the performance of the three species-specific models using two datasets, independent deer hunting returns and deer densities based on faecal pellet counts. Our work clearly demonstrates the applicability of spatially explicit ISDMs to empirical data in a Bayesian context, providing a blueprint for managers to exploit unexplored and seemingly unusable data that can, when modelled with the proper tools, serve to inform management and conservation policies.},

In this study, we examined the usefulness of both methods to assess the impact of exotic trout on native charr. 2 Brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss have been introduced world-wide. They are invading many streams in Japan that also harbour native salmonids. We studied these species and the endemic Asian white-spotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis in the Hekirichi River, south-western Hokkaido, Japan. We estimated the densities of all three species in pools and riffles from 27 stream reaches over 2 successive years. Data were analysed by regression and isodar methods to infer interspecific interactions. 3 The regression method identified a negative relationship between brown trout and white-spotted charr densities, implying that brown trout are replacing white-spotted charr. 4 The isodar method identified significant competition for habitat between rainbow trout and white-spotted charr. This method suggested that white-spotted charr preferred pools to riffles when rainbow trout were scarce but moved from pools to riffles as trout density in the pools increased. 5 Synthesis and applications. Although they are based on limited data, regression and isodar methods were able to evaluate the potential impact of exotic trout on native white-spotted charr. From these results, we were able to hypothesize mechanisms of displacement of native charr by exotic trout. However, according to the two methods the mechanisms underlying the negative impacts on charr differ between brown and rainbow trout; in other words, limitations exist for both methods. From a more practical viewpoint, the analyses conducted in this study may be useful tools for conservation biologists who have limitations on their time and effort but must assess the impacts of exotics on native species.},

In particular, it is important to understand the patterns and drivers of spatial variation in local community dynamics, generalizing temporal trends from discrete locations to entire landscapes that are the main focus of management. Here, we present a framework for producing spatially continuous views of community dynamics, focusing on stream fish affected by hydropower development. Location River Sabor, NE Portugal. Methods We sampled stream fish at thirty sites between 2012 and 2019. Community trajectory analysis was used to quantify the directionality and velocity of community change, and the geometric resemblance of community trajectories between sites. Geostatistical models for stream networks were used to relate metrics describing community dynamics to environmental variables, while controlling for Euclidean and hydrologic spatial dependencies, and to map spatial variation in community dynamics across the watershed. Results Trajectories in multivariate space underlined strong temporal dynamics, with local communities deviating and returning to previous states, but without evidence for directional changes. Accordingly, directionality values were low and not consistently affected by environmental variables. The velocity of community change varied markedly across the watershed and it was strongly affected by stream order and elevation, with faster changes observed in lowland streams draining into hydroelectric reservoirs and with a high proportion of exotic species. Pairwise distances between community trajectories were strongly related to hydrologic and environmental distances between sites. Main conclusions Local stream fish communities were in a loose equilibrium across the watershed, but they fluctuated at a faster rate closer to a hydroelectric reservoir. Integrating community trajectory analysis and geostatistical modelling provides a relatively simple framework to understand how, where and why temporal community dynamics vary across dendritic stream networks and to visualize spatial patterns of community change over time in relation to anthropogenic impacts.},

Since that time, our knowledge of California's freshwater fishes has dramatically increased. This completely revised edition incorporates a vast amount of new information and creates a fresh synthesis of the historical data. Written by the leading expert on California's freshwater fishes and illustrated with beautiful line drawings, this compendium is the single best source for understanding and identifying the state's freshwater fishes. It is an essential resource for anyone who needs to have accurate and detailed information on California's fishes at their fingertips. Since the 1870s, the state's native fishes have been joined by thirty-four alien species, which now dominate many bodies of water. This book treats both native and introduced species, first in a key for identification, and then in individual species accounts covering characteristics, taxonomy, names, distribution, and life history. Each account includes the author's personal assessment of how well the species is doing and problems associated with its management. Most of the native fishes are found only in California and show many wonderful adaptations for living in the state's diverse waters. Unfortunately, many are also in danger of extinction. The message underlying the first edition of this book was that we knew astonishingly little about many of California's inland fishes. Although our knowledge is increasing, full accounts of some native fishes may not be complete before they become extinct. Preventing the loss of native fishes is the major goal of this book, and Moyle makes important suggestions for conservation strategies as well as presenting up-to-date information on ecology, life history, and distribution. With this knowledge, preserving our native fishes becomes possible even in the face of the state's growing economy and population.},

Ecological changes (e.g., invasive species) altering the food web structure accompanied with shifts in prey abundance, necessitate understanding the trophic niches of Lake Ontario salmonids to aid in management. The objectives of this study were to quantify salmonid (5 species) trophic niches and dietary proportions using stable isotope ratios ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N) of a large sample set (adult fish ({$>$}300\,mm; n\,=\,672) and key offshore prey (5 species, n\,=\,2037)) collected across Lake Ontario in 2013. Estimates of prey based on stable isotope ratios were similar to stomach contents. Based on stable isotope ratios, non-native prey dominated salmonid diet; in particular alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) constituted the majority (0.31 to 0.93) of all salmonid diets, and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) contributed 0.26 and 0.19 of brown trout (Salmo trutta) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) diets, respectively. Trophic niche overlap was high between all salmonids, except lake trout. The largest trophic niche overlap occurred between Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and their reliance on alewife infers a strong pelagic foraging strategy. Lake, brown and rainbow (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout had larger and/or more distinct trophic niches indicative of a more variable diet across individuals and utilizing different foraging strategies and/or habitats. Overall, Lake Ontario salmonids maintained a high reliance on alewife, and their potential for plasticity in diet provides important information to management regarding population sustainability.},

The fishes within a single pool in the stream formed an interspecific size-structured dominance hierarchy. Dominant individuals of both species maintained foraging territories against both subordinate conspecifics and heterospecifics, whereas subordinate charr adopted nonterritorial tactics. In each species, the most dominant fish usually held the focal point nearest to the pool inlet, which ensured priority of access to drifting food, with subordinates distributed farther downstream. Foraging microhabitats differed vertically in the water column between the two species, charr utilizing a home range near the stream bed and salmon occupying the midlayer. The frequency of foraging attempts by salmon was considerably higher than that by charr. Although daily body mass increments of dominant individuals were significantly larger than those of conspecific subordinates in each species, those of some subordinate salmon exceeded those of dominant charr.}

Underwater observations on individuals of both species revealed two distinct behavioral regimes: aggressive drift foragers and non-aggressive benthos foragers. Aggressive drift foragers defended partial territories around focal points from which they made forays to capture invertebrates drifting in the water column. Non-aggressive benthos foragers cruised around and beneath cobble in large foraging ranges that overlapped each other. Intra- and interspecific, size-dependent dominance hierarchies were recognized among aggressive drift foragers, whereas non-aggressive benthos foragers showed no such relationships. Terrestrial invertebrates were the most abundant prey in the diets of drift foragers, whereas a very small proportion of the diet of benthos foragers was made up of these taxa. Benthos foragers showed more complex diet composition than drift foragers. These results suggest that non-aggressive benthos foragers may avoid not only interference but also exploitative competition by using alternative foraging tactics. The proportion of drift foragers to benthos foragers among white-spotted char was more than 35 times that among Dolly Varden. The significant difference in the proportion of each species using the two types of foraging strategy results in interspecific food segregation in sympatric populations.},

  abstract = {The important contribution of terrestrial invertebrates to the energy budget of drift-foraging fishes has been well documented in many forested headwater streams. However, relatively little attention has been focused on the behavioral mechanisms behind such intensive exploitation. We tested for the hypothesis that active prey selection by fishes would be an important determinant of terrestrial invertebrates contribution to fish diets in a forested headwater stream in northern Japan. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were estimated to consume 57.12 mg m-2 day-1 (dry mass) terrestrial invertebrates, 77\% of their total input (73.89 mg m-2 day-1), there being high selectivity for the former from stream drift. Both the falling input and drift of terrestrial invertebrates peaked at around dusk, decreasing dramatically toward midnight. In contrast, both aquatic insect adults and benthic invertebrates showed pronounced nocturnal drift. Because the prey consumption rates of rainbow trout were high at dawn and dusk, decreasing around midnight, the greater contribution of terrestrial invertebrates to trout diet was regarded as being partly influenced by the difference in diel periodicity of availability among prey categories. In addition, selectivity also depended upon differences in individual prey size among aquatic insect adults, and benthic and terrestrial invertebrates, the last category being largest in both the stream drift and the trout diets. We concluded that differences in both the timing of supplies and prey size among the three prey categories were the primary factors behind the selective foraging on terrestrial invertebrates by rainbow trout.},

  abstract = {Fine-scale underwater telemetry affords an unprecedented opportunity to understand how aquatic animals respond to environmental changes. We investigated the movement patterns of an aquatic top predator, Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), using a three-dimensional acoustic telemetry system installed in Kleiner D{\"o}llnsee (25 ha), a small, shallow, mesotrophic natural lake. Adult piscivorous perch (N = 16) were tagged and tracked in the whole lake at a minimum of 9-s intervals over the course of one year. Perch increased swimming activity with higher water temperature and light intensity. Air pressure, wind speed and lunar phase also explained perch movements, but the effects were substantially smaller compared to temperature and light. Perch showed a strong diel pattern in activity, with farther swimming distances and larger activity spaces during the daytime, compared to the night-time. To investigate the influence of prey distribution, we sampled the prey fish in both littoral and pelagic zones in both day and night monthly using gill nets. We found that the prey fish underwent diel horizontal migration, using the littoral zone during the day and the pelagic zone during the night. However, perch showed the opposite patterns, suggesting either that the prey fish avoided predation risk or that the horizontal diel migration of perch was driven by other mechanisms. Our results collectively suggest that the movement ecology of piscivorous perch is mainly governed by a foraging motivation as a function of abiotic variables, especially temperature and light.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.''Now we must consider in general the common reason for moving with any movement whatever.`` (Aristotle, De Motu Animalium, 4th century B.C.)},

Of 321 recaptures, 62 fish (19.3\%) moved across at least one riffle (i.e., were ``mobile''). Fish moved distances of up to 192 m (median = 4 m). Distance moved (m) by all fish correlated positively with the recapture interval (d) in both years, illustrating the importance of the temporal dimension for movements. Mean daily distance moved (m/d) in the high-flow year was greater than that in the low-flow year. The high-flow year, which had a higher frequency of peak flow events, had a higher frequency of mobile fish than did the low-flow year, suggesting that interannual variation in movements is related to streamflow. Fish size and growth did not differ between mobile fish and residents in the high-flow year; however, mobile fish were larger and grew more slowly than residents in the low-flow year. Patterns of movement from multiple recaptures showed evidence for round-trip movements at channel unit and reach scales, but no fish completed round-trip movements by crossing a small weir ({$<$}0.5 m in height). These results emphasize the importance of maintaining fish passage and pool-riffle sequences throughout the stream course to prevent isolation of subpopulations by weirs, culverts, and road crossings. Physical barriers to Japanese fluvial sculpin movements could be mitigated by placing a ramp of cobbles downstream of the barriers.}

  abstract = {Coexistence of ecomorphologically similar species in diverse Neotropical ecosystems has been a focus of long-term debate among ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Such coexistence can be promoted by trophic plasticity and seasonal changes in omnivorous feeding. We combined stomach content and stable isotope analyses to determine how seasonal variation in resource availability influences the consumption and assimilation of resources by two syntopic fish species, Psalidodon aff. gymnodontus and P. bifasciatus, in the Lower Igua{\c c}u basin. We also tested the impact of seasonality on trophic niche breadth and diet overlap of these two dominant omnivores. Seasonal changes in resource availability strongly influenced the consumption and assimilation of resources by the two fish species. Both species exhibited high levels of omnivory, characterized by high diversity of allochthonous resources in the wet season. Terrestrial invertebrates were the main component of diet during this season. However, in the dry season, both species reduced their isotopic niches, indicating diet specialization. High diet overlap was observed in both seasons, but the isotopic niche overlap was smaller in the dry season. Substantial reduction in the isotopic niche of P. bifascistus and a shift toward aquatic invertebrates can facilitate coexistence during this season of resource shortage. Feeding plasticity allows omnivorous fish to adjust their trophic niches according to seasonality, promoting the exploitation of different resources during periods of greater resource diversity. This seasonal variation could be an important mechanism that contributes to the resource partitioning and coexistence of dominant omnivores in Neotropical streams.},

Here, we investigated how ecological opportunity and interspecific competition affect the degree of individual trophic specialization and the population niche breadth in tetra fish. We studied the four ecologically similar species (Psalidodon aff. gymnodontus, P. aff. paranae, P. bifasciatus, and Bryconamericus ikaa) in subtropical headwater streams (three sites with two co-occurring species and three sites with only one species). We sampled fish in two contrasting seasons (winter/dry and summer/wet) and quantified their trophic niches using gut content analysis. Psalidodon bifasciatus was the only species distributed over all the sampled streams. We observed seasonal differences in population trophic niche breadth of P. bifasciatus just when this species co-occurred with P. aff. gymnodontus. These findings confirm the complex nature of the effects of interspecific competition, depending, for instance, on the identity of the competitor. The degree of individual specialization of P. bifasciatus was higher in the winter, and it was not influenced by the presence of another species. Conversely, the other two Psalidodon species studied presented greater individual specialization in the summer, when fish consumed a higher proportion of allochthonous items (terrestrial insects and seeds), and there were no effects only for B. ikaa. Herein, our results suggest that seasonality in food-resource availability is a major driver of niche variation and it has the potential to play an important role in how these similar tetra species interact and coexist.

Methodology By accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of Bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. Conclusions We outline a framework that builds on recently published Bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source R package, SIAR. The formulation in R will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.},

Metacommunity theory describes how multiple species from different communities potentially interact with local-scale environmental drivers to influence population dynamics and community structure. However, this body of knowledge has only rarely been used to inform management practices for river ecosystems. In this article, we present a conceptual model outlining how the metacommunity processes of local niche sorting and dispersal can influence the outcomes of management interventions and provide a series of specific recommendations for applying these ideas as well as research needs. In all cases, we identify situations where traditional approaches to riverine management could be enhanced by incorporating an understanding of metacommunity dynamics. A common theme is developing guidelines for assessing the metacommunity context of a site or region, evaluating how that context may affect the desired outcome, and incorporating that understanding into the planning process and methods used. To maximize the effectiveness of management activities, scientists, and resource managers should update the toolbox of approaches to riverine management to reflect theoretical advances in metacommunity ecology.

Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the seasonal and diel differences in movement rates, site fidelity, and home range of bluegills in a shallow, natural Great Plains lake. A total of 78 bluegills (200--273 mm total length) were implanted with radio transmitters in March and May 2000. Of these fish, 10 males and 10 females were randomly selected and located every 2 h during one 24-h period each month from April to September 2000. Bluegill movement peaked during midsummer; however, there was little difference in diel movements, suggesting relatively consistent movement throughout the 24-h period. Home range estimates (which included the 24-h tracking plus an additional six locations from the same fish located once per day for six consecutive days each month) ranged up to 172 ha, probably because only about half of the bluegills exhibited site fidelity during any month sampled. Bluegill movement did not appear to be strongly linked with water temperature, barometric pressure, or wind speed. These results suggest that bluegills move considerable distances and that many roam throughout this 332-ha shallow lake. However, diel patterns were not evident. Sampling bluegills in Great Plains lakes using passive gears (e.g., trap nets) may be most effective during the summer months, when fish are most active. Active sampling (e.g., electrofishing) may be more effective than the use of passive gears in spring and fall, when bluegills are less active.},

In contrast, little is known about how temperature influences ectotherm performance in the wild, so the ecological significance of physiological performance as measured in the laboratory is unclear. Our aim was to measure the temperature dependence of performance in the wild for several species of fishes and to explore how temperatures that maximize performance in the wild (ToptE) are related to species biogeographies. We gathered body activity and growth data from the wild for nine tropical and temperate fish species, and by fitting thermal performance curves to these data, compared ToptE to species-specific warm range boundary temperatures (the average temperature of the warmest month at equatorward range limits). To explore the degree to which trends in the wild reflect trends in physiological performance measured in the laboratory, we also compiled published data on the temperature dependence of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and compared these to our wild fish data. We found ToptE in the wild was strongly correlated with warm range boundary temperatures, and that the difference between these two temperatures (the `environmental heating tolerance') was smaller for more-tropical species. Comparison with laboratory data revealed that ToptE approaches warm boundary temperatures in the wild at the same rate that the optimal temperature for aerobic scope (ToptAS) approaches upper critical temperatures (upper Tcrit) for aerobic scope in the laboratory, meaning that environmental heating tolerances in wild fishes closely mirror physiological heating tolerance (i.e. upper Tcrit - ToptAS) in captive fishes. Our comparison of field- and laboratory-derived data highlights the ecological significance of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and suggests wild fish species tend to perform best near the highest temperatures encountered in their range while maintaining a safety margin from the deleterious effects of upper critical temperatures.},

Yet, to fully understand the rates of intra- and interspecific encounters among individuals, observations at finer spatial and temporal scales might be necessary. We used passive integrated transponder tags and antenna arrays to continuously monitor habitat use and vagility of three stream minnows; southern redbelly dace Chrosomus erythrogaster, central stoneroller Campostoma anomalum, and creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, among and within pools of an intermittent stream. Most fish remained in the pool where they were caught and released, or returned after emigrating from the pool. Despite largely remaining within the release pool, distribution among four microhabitats differed significantly over six, 4-h time periods for all three species. Vagility, the summed distance moved among antennas, differed significantly among species. Individual vagility (m~day-1) increased significantly with body length for stoneroller and chub, but not dace. Some individuals moved as much as 110~m~day-1 within the pool, showcasing extensive movement at fine scales. Finally, we found no evidence that feeding activity changed as a result of differential habitat use over a 24-h period. Our findings indicate considerable variation in habitat use and movement occurs among species over a 24-h period. This suggests ecologists can broaden the interpretation of processes influencing community structure (e.g., resource partitioning, avoidance of predators) by quantifying species distributions across a range of spatial and temporal scales.},

This study presents a modeling framework based on dispersal kernels (modified Laplace distributions) that describe stream fish dispersal in the presence of obstacles to passage. We used mark--recapture trials to quantify summer dispersal of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in four streams crossed by a highway. The analysis identified population heterogeneity in dispersal behavior, as revealed by the presence of a dominant sedentary component (48--72\% of all individuals) characterized by short mean dispersal distance (,10 m), and a secondary mobile component characterized by longer mean dispersal distance (56--1086 m). We did not detect evidence of barrier effects on dispersal through highway crossings. Simulation of various plausible scenarios indicated that detectability of barrier effects was strongly dependent on features of sampling design, such as spatial configuration of the sampling area, barrier extent, and sample size. The proposed modeling framework extends conventional dispersal kernels by incorporating structural barriers. A major strength of the approach is that ecological process (dispersal model) and sampling design (observation model) are incorporated simultaneously into the analysis. This feature can facilitate the use of prior knowledge to improve sampling efficiency of mark--recapture trials in movement studies. Model-based estimation of barrier permeability and its associated uncertainty provides a rigorous approach for quantifying the effect of barriers on stream fish dispersal and assessing population dynamics of stream fish in fragmented landscapes.},

  abstract = {Invasive alien species constitute a major threat to the world's freshwater ecosystems. Human translocations as well as rising temperatures have allowed freshwater fish species to expand their distribution into novel ecosystems, often with negative effects on native biodiversity. Early intervention is key to restricting damage and further spread of invasive aliens. This makes identification of areas with high risk for the establishment of invasive alien species necessary in order to target monitoring and mitigation measures. Here, we model lake-specific likelihood of establishment of five freshwater fish species which are increasing their distribution in Norway. In order to establish the likelihood of establishment resulting from human translocation, environmental factors or natural dispersal from an established population, a suite of anthropogenic and environmental covariates were included as predictors. We used these models to create a future scenario which modelled establishment risk for these species over a 50-year time period. Connectivity of lakes to other extant populations and anthropogenic covariates influenced likelihood of establishment---and subsequently future establishment risk---the most across all species. The effects of temperature were variable, and for the most part had little effect on likelihood of establishment. Our results indicate that human behaviour, infrastructure development and alternations of watershed connectivity are more important than climate induced range shifts on a short to medium time horizon. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates how risk assessments of invasive establishment can be synthesised based on readily available open data sources. This allows for the construction of tools to forecast invasion hotspots as a basis for designing mitigation actions, including early monitoring programs, horizon scanning initiatives and eradication measures. It also allows managers to determine where species are spreading as a result of direct human translocation, and where they are expanding as a result of increased temperatures.},

To synthesize how land use change has altered multiple components of stream biodiversity across scales, we compiled data from 37 studies where comparative data were available for species' total and relative abundances from multiple locations including reference (less impacted) streams to those surrounded by different land use types (urban, forestry, and agriculture). We found that each type of land use reduced multiple components of within-stream biodiversity across scales, but that urbanization consistently had the strongest effects. However, we found that {$\beta$}-diversity among streams in modified landscapes did not differ from {$\beta$}-diversity observed among reference streams, suggesting little evidence for biotic homogenization. Nevertheless, assemblage composition did experience considerable species turnover between reference and modified streams. Our results emphasize that to understand how anthropogenic factors such as land use alter biodiversity, multiple components of biodiversity within and among sites must be simultaneously considered at multiple scales.},

Our objectives were to: (i) quantify the overall rate of sculpin movement, (ii) assess variation in movement among years, individuals, and sculpin size classes, (iii) relate movement to variation in stream flow and population size structure, and (iv) quantify relationships between movement and individual growth rates. 2. Movements were very restricted: median and mean movement distances for all sculpin size classes over a 45 day period were 1.3 and 4.4 m respectively. Nevertheless, there was a high degree of intrapopulation and temporal variation in sculpin movement. Movement of juveniles increased with discharge and with the density of large adults. Movement by small and large adults was not influenced by stream flow, but large adults where more mobile when their own density was high. Finally, there were differences in the growth rates of mobile and sedentary sculpins. Mobile juveniles grew faster than sedentary individuals under conditions of low flow and high density of large adults, whereas adults exhibited the opposite pattern. 3. Our results support the hypothesis that juvenile movement and growth is influenced by both intraspecific interactions with adults and stream flow. In contrast, adult movement appears to be influenced by competitive interactions among residents for suitable space. The relationship between movement and growth may provide a negative feedback mechanism regulating mottled sculpin populations in this system.},

However, we have a relatively poor understanding of how animals move at fine temporal scales and in three-dimensional environments. Here, we collected high temporal resolution data on the three-dimensional spatial positions of individual three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), allowing us to derive statistics describing key geometric characteristics of their movement and to quantify the extent to which this varies between individuals. We then used these statistics to develop a simple model of fish movement and evaluated the biological plausibility of simulated movement paths using a Turing-type test, which quantified the association preferences of live fish towards animated conspecifics following either `real' (i.e., based on empirical measurements) or simulated movements. Live fish showed no difference in their response to `real' movement compared to movement simulated by the model, although significantly preferred modelled movement over putatively unnatural movement patterns. The model therefore has the potential to facilitate a greater understanding of the causes and consequences of individual variation in movement, as well as enabling the construction of agent-based models or real-time computer animations in which individual fish move in biologically feasible ways.},

However, these techniques have received little notice from fisheries biologists, despite the widespread applicability to fisheries research, the wide variety of tag types used in fisheries research (from traditional fin clips to telemetry tags), and the development of new computer software to assist with analyses. We present a brief review of population models based on recaptures, returns, or telemetry relocations of tagged fish that can be used to estimate population size, total mortality, and components of mortality (i.e., fishing and natural) that are frequently of interest to fisheries biologists. Recommended strategies include (1) use closed population models (e.g., Lincoln-Peterson) to estimate population size for short term studies where closure assumption can be met, (2) use the robust design to estimate population size for studies of longer duration, (3) use high-reward tags in conjunction with other methods of estimating reporting rate in tag-return studies, (4) combine a subset of telemetry tagged fish with either a high-reward tagging program or a traditional capture-recapture study to improve mortality estimates and understanding of mortality components, and (5) use pilot studies and simulation analyses to assess precision of estimated parameters to evaluate study feasibility. Incorporation of these improved techniques could lead to greater accuracy and precision of parameter estimates from tagging studies and thus to improved understanding and management of fish populations.},

In this paper, using oak assemblages distributed across the continental United States obtained from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), we assessed the performance of stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs), constructed using satellite remote sensing as covariates and under a Bayesian framework, in order to build the next-generation of biodiversity models. This study represents an attempt to evaluate the integrated predictions of biodiversity models---including assemblage diversity and composition---obtained by stacking next-generation SDMs. We found three main results. First, environmental predictors derived entirely from satellite remote sensing represent adequate covariates for biodiversity modeling. Second, applying constraints to assemblage predictions, such as imposing the probability ranking rule, not necessarily results in more accurate species diversity predictions. Third, independent of the stacking procedure (bS-SDM versus pS-SDM versus cS-SDM), this kind of biodiversity models do not accurately recover the observed species composition at plot level or ecological scales (NEON plots), however, they do return reasonable predictions at macroecological scales, i.e., mid to high correct assignment of species identities at the scale of NEON sites. Our results provide insights for the prediction of assemblage diversity and composition at different spatial scales. An important task for future studies is to evaluate the reliability of combining S-SDMs with direct detection of species using image spectroscopy to build a new generation of biodiversity models to accurately predict and monitor ecological assemblages through time and space.},

Intra- and inter-specific trophic niche overlap under resource limitation is a measure of competitive interactions and influences species coexistence and community dynamics, but patterns of this overlap are influenced by anthropogenic activities. To investigate seasonal trophic niche dynamics of coexisting fish species in a flow-altered river, we analysed prey resources, stomach content samples and stable isotope signatures of mottled sculpin Cottus bairdii and juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta in the Blue River, Colorado, USA, a high-elevation oligotrophic river. Prey biomass (i.e. benthic macroinvertebrates) peaked in spring and declined through summer and autumn. Stomach content and stable isotope analysis results showed that diet composition of mottled sculpin and brown trout varied seasonally in response to changes in prey availability. Stomach content analysis results revealed that in autumn, both species exhibited the highest frequency of empty stomachs and expanded population trophic niches due to increased inter-individual diet variation despite decreased individual trophic niche breadth. Inter-specific trophic niche overlap was relatively high across all seasons, but the lowest degree of overlap occurred in autumn of both years when prey availability was lowest. Isotopic analysis revealed similar trends to stomach content analysis, of wider isotopic niches and reduced overlap in autumn compared to spring. Our data indicated that seasonal variation affected individual- and population-level trophic niche dynamics and inter-specific niche overlap between mottled sculpin and brown trout. This trophic segregation under resource limitation may serve as a mechanism that facilitates species coexistence in a flow-regulated, oligotrophic river.},

We performed a number of spatially explicit, individual-based simulation experiments to test these predictions and to explore further the relevance of variation in the rate of population increase, density dependence, environmental fluctuations and dispersal mortality on the evolution of dispersal rates. They confirm the predictions of our analytical approach. In addition, they show that dispersal rates in metapopulations mostly depend on dispersal mortality and inter-patch variation in population density. The latter is dominantly driven by environmental fluctuations and the rate of population increase. These conclusions are not altered by the introduction of neighbourhood dispersal. With patch capacities in the order of 100 individuals, kin competition seems to be of negligible importance for ES dispersal rates except when overall dispersal rates are low.},

In aphids, the presence of predators triggers the production of winged offspring that may later leave the plant and shift their center of activity permanently. Using individual-based simulations as well as analytical approximations, we explore under which conditions PID is likely to evolve. We demonstrate that this requires substantial temporal correlation in predation risk and weak competition among prey; these conditions may be fulfilled in the aphid system. We discuss the analogy between the specific case of PID and the evolution of conditional emigration in the face of spatiotemporally correlated deterioration in reproduction or survival.},

  abstract = {Conceptual and methodological tools from behavioral ecology can inform studies of habitat quality, and their potential for evaluating habitat restoration in conservation efforts is explored here. Such approaches provide mechanistic detail in understanding the relationship between organisms and their habitats and are thus more informative than correlations between density and habitat characteristics. Several Pacific salmon species have been the target of habitat restoration efforts for the past 2--3 decades, but most post-restoration effectiveness studies have been limited to correlative data described above. In mark--recapture assays from four different study years, the affinity of sub-yearling Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) for stream pools restored with or created by engineered log structures was greater than that for pools without restoration, though with high interannual variability. From corresponding distribution and density data, it was clear that habitat affinity data are not always concordant with single observations of density. The same was true of the correlation between either affinity or density and physical characteristics of pools, although depth and current velocity had some explanatory power for both responses in Chinook. Movement into pools by Chinook during the assays indicated that restored pools can support more immigrants at a given density than can unrestored pools; however, no such pattern emerged for steelhead. Variation among individuals in body condition has implications for population-wide fitness, and such low variation was correlated with stronger affinity for pools in Chinook regardless of restoration status. This suggests that pools may mediate habitat-related trade-offs and that restoring them might have a positive effect on fitness. Thus affinity, immigration, and condition data give much-needed mechanistic indication of habitat selection for restored habitat via an apparent capacity increase and those potential fitness benefits. This is stronger support for restoration effectiveness than density differences alone because density data (1) may simply indicate redistribution of fish from poor to good habitats and (2) are not adequate to show correlations between restoration and positive change in traits correlated with fitness.},

  abstract = {A primary goal of ecology is to understand the fundamental processes underlying the geographic distributions of species. Two major strands of ecology -- habitat modelling and community ecology -- approach this problem differently. Habitat modellers often use species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify the relationship between species' and their environments without considering potential biotic interactions. Community ecologists, on the other hand, tend to focus on biotic interactions and, in observational studies, use co-occurrence patterns to identify ecological processes. Here, we describe a joint species distribution model (JSDM) that integrates these distinct observational approaches by incorporating species co-occurrence data into a SDM. JSDMs estimate distributions of multiple species simultaneously and allow decomposition of species co-occurrence patterns into components describing shared environmental responses and residual patterns of co-occurrence. We provide a general description of the model, a tutorial and code for fitting the model in R. We demonstrate this modelling approach using two case studies: frogs and eucalypt trees in Victoria, Australia. Overall, shared environmental correlations were stronger than residual correlations for both frogs and eucalypts, but there were cases of strong residual correlation. Frog species generally had positive residual correlations, possibly due to the fact these species occurred in similar habitats that were not fully described by the environmental variables included in the JSDM. Eucalypt species that interbreed had similar environmental responses but had negative residual co-occurrence. One explanation is that interbreeding species may not form stable assemblages despite having similar environmental affinities. Environmental and residual correlations estimated from JSDMs can help indicate whether co-occurrence is driven by shared environmental responses or other ecological or evolutionary process (e.g. biotic interactions), or if important predictor variables are missing. JSDMs take into account the fact that distributions of species might be related to each other and thus overcome a major limitation of modelling species distributions independently.},

We evaluated the reliability of direct chemical extraction, which physically removes lipids from samples, and mathematical normalization, which uses the carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio of a sample to normalize {$\delta$}13C after analysis by measuring the lipid content, the C:N ratio, and the effect of lipid content on {$\delta$}13C ({$\Delta\delta$}13C) of plants and animals with a wide range of lipid contents. For animals, we found strong relationships between C:N and lipid content, between lipid content and {$\Delta\delta$}13C, and between C:N and {$\Delta\delta$}13C. For plants, C:N was not a good predictor of lipid content or {$\Delta\delta$}13C, but we found a strong relationship between carbon content and lipid content, lipid content and {$\Delta\delta$}13C, and between and carbon content and {$\Delta\delta$}13C. Our results indicate that lipid extraction or normalization is most important when lipid content is variable among consumers of interest or between consumers and end members, and when differences in {$\delta$}13C between end members is {$<$}10--12‰. The vast majority of studies using natural variation in {$\delta$}13C fall within these criteria. Both direct lipid extraction and mathematical normalization reduce biases in {$\delta$}13C, but mathematical normalization simplifies sample preparation and better preserves the integrity of samples for {$\delta$}15N analysis.},

  abstract = {The continuum hypothesis states that both deterministic and stochastic processes contribute to the assembly of ecological communities. However, the contextual dependency of these processes remains an open question that imposes strong limitations on predictions of community responses to environmental change. Here we measure community and habitat turnover across multiple vertical soil horizons at 183 sites across Scotland for bacteria and fungi, both dominant and functionally vital components of all soils but which differ substantially in their growth habit and dispersal capability. We find that habitat turnover is the primary driver of bacterial community turnover in general, although its importance decreases with increasing isolation and disturbance. Fungal communities, however, exhibit a highly stochastic assembly process, both neutral and non-neutral in nature, largely independent of disturbance. These findings suggest that increased focus on dispersal limitation and biotic interactions are necessary to manage and conserve the key ecosystem services provided by these assemblages.},

This research aims at studying the space and time variation of fish community structure in the Seti Gandaki River, Tanahu, Nepal. The field survey was conducted from July 2017 to June 2018 and the fishes were sampled from six sites using a medium size cast net of mesh size ranging from 3 mm to 6 mm mesh size, 25-33 feet length and 3.5-5 feet width, with the help of local fisher man. A total of 1,440 individuals were caught representing 46 species belonging to three order, nine families and 23 genera. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed significant difference in space (R = 0.824, P = 0.001) but not in time (R = 0.135, P = 0.021). On the basis of similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis, 85.43\% similarity was found among the seasons and major contributing species were Barilius bendelisis (8.44\%) followed by B. vagra (7.79\%), Tor putitora (7.27\%), Garra gotyla (7\%), Acanthocobotis botia (6.7\%), Neolissochilus hexagonolepis (6.64\%), Barilius shacra (6\%), B. barila (4.5\%) and Opsarius barna (4.37\%). On the other hand, 85.24\% similarity was found among the sites and major contributing species were B. bendelisis (8.8\%) followed by B. vagra (7.6\%), G. gotyla (7.27\%), T. putitora (7.17\%), A. botia (6.97\%), N. hexagonolepis (6.7\%), B. shacra (6.34\%), B. barila (4.7\%) and O. barna (4.39\%).

  abstract = {Native fishes of the Upper Colorado River Basin have experienced substantial declines in abundance and distribution, and are extirpated from most of Wyoming. Muddy Creek, in south-central Wyoming (Little Snake River watershed), contains sympatric populations of native roundtail chub (Gila robusta), bluehead sucker, (Catostomus discobolus), and flannelmouth sucker (C. latipinnis), and represents an area of high conservation concern because it is the only area known to have sympatric populations of all 3 species in Wyoming. However, introduced creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) are abundant and might have a negative influence on native fishes. We assessed summer food habits of roundtail chub and creek chub to provide information on the ecology of each species and obtain insight on potential trophic overlap. Roundtail chub and creek chub seemed to be opportunistic generalists that consumed a diverse array of food items. Stomach contents of both species were dominated by plant material, aquatic and terrestrial insects, and fishes, but also included gastropods and mussels. Stomach contents were similar between species, indicating high trophic overlap. No length-related patterns in diet were observed for either species. These results suggest that creek chubs have the potential to adversely influence the roundtail chub population through competition for food and the native fish assemblage through predation. /// Peces nativos de Upper Colorado River Basin han experimentado una decadencia substancial en abundancia y distribuci{\'o}n, y han sido eliminados de la mayor parte del Estado de Wyoming.

Our spatially explicit version of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, analyzed using a Bayesian framework, correlates movement between periods and can incorporate environmental or other covariates. We demonstrate the model using 2010 data for anadromous American shad ( Alosa sapidissima) tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT) at a weir near the mouth of a North Carolina river and passively monitored with an upstream array of PIT antennas. The river channel constrained migrations, resulting in linear, one-dimensional encounter histories that included both weir captures and antenna detections. Individual activity centres in a given time period were a function of the individual's previous estimated location and the river conditions (i.e., gage height). Model results indicate high within-river spawning mortality (mean weekly survival = 0.80) and more extensive movements during elevated river conditions. This model is applicable for any linear array (e.g., rivers, shorelines, and corridors), opening new opportunities to study demographic parameters, movement or migration, and habitat use. (English)},

  abstract = {Quantifying fish dispersal and identifying its general predictors is key for understanding temporal patterns in population dynamics, emigration and immigration, meta-community dynamics, many ecological processes and predicting recovery time or population responses to environmental changes. This is the first comprehensive quantitative meta-analysis of heterogeneous freshwater fish movement, aiming to determine mobile and stationary shares of fish communities, their dispersal distances and key predictors of dispersal patterns. By reviewing and analysing 160 empirical data sets from 71 studies covering 62 fishes in streams, it goes beyond previous studies of salmonids' heterogeneous movement. Based on fitted leptokurtic dispersal kernels, the movement distances of (i) a stationary component ({$\sigma$}stat) and (ii) a mobile component ({$\sigma$}mob) as well as the (iii) share of each component (p) were calculated. The median movement distance of the stationary and mobile component of a fish population was 36.4 and 361.7 m, respectively. The share of the stationary individuals was high (median = 66.6\%), but unrelated to movement distance. Single and multiple linear regressions as well as mixed-effects models revealed movement distances positively related to fish length, aspect ratio of the caudal fin, stream size and duration of the study. Furthermore, movement distance differed between taxonomic families. The quantitative parameters of heterogeneous fish movement provided are prerequisite to estimate time lags in fish response to river rehabilitation, temporal patterns in species dispersal, and minimum effective size of potential founder populations for species conservation and stock recovery based on minimum numbers of specimen to disperse.},

  abstract = {In spring lakes, which have homogeneous environmental characteristics, it is expected that there will be no significant changes in the composition and structure of communities over time, and fluctuations will generally be related to the ecological attributes of the species. We studied the fish community in a small subtropical spring lake, Lake Zacapu, for two different decades to analyse its structural characteristics. Sampling was performed every 3 months at four sites from January to October 1995 and from May 2019 to May 2020. We determined the temporal variation (seasonal and decadal) in the fish community structure with respect to composition, abundance, diversity and dominance. We evaluated the association between species and water quality. Our results showed spatial homogeneity in most physicochemical variables that remained in the same range across decades, although some nutrients (NO3) recently increased. All species identified in the early samples were present in the recent surveys (eleven native and two nonnative species), indicating that the fish community composition had significant qualitative stability. However, the dominant littoral cyprinid in 1995 was replaced by the more limnetic atherinopsid in 2019--2020, and the diversity and abundance of sensitive fish decreased in recent samplings. Consequently, the current status of critically endangered species is supported for some restricted and microendemic fish. The changes in the community structure attributes, which show a tendency for reduction in native species, emphasise the need to implement efforts to conserve freshwater fish diversity in small spring lakes.},

Expression of movement behavior has traditionally been termed dispersal and measured relative to home ranges. This simplistic approach belies the complexity of the process. Movement of freshwater stream fish has been at times viewed as predominantly restricted in nature, but recent research challenges this paradigm since some distribution of movement exists in every population. A better research approach is to understand the drivers that promote or limit movement. Drivers of movement can be categorized as extrinsic ecological factors (context dependent), e.g., habitat quality, habitat variability, and the presence of predators, and intrinsic traits of the fish (condition dependent), such as body size and condition. One intrinsic trait that has received relatively little attention is the inherent personality to be sedentary or mobile, and how this interacts with the suite of traits and behaviors to drive movement. Future movement behavior research should focus on the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers to better understand the evolutionary and ecological implications of movement.},

  abstract = {In the 12 years since Dudgeon et al. (2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3\% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5\% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83\% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.},

It is thought that carbon fixation in aquatic plants having thicker, stagnant boundary layers, such as that which occurs within low turbulence lentic systems, will result in more positive delta13C values due to greater diffusion resistance and subsequent assimilation of otherwise normally discriminated 13C. The present study confirms this hypothesis by examining 876 algal delta13C values collected from the literature. The average delta13C value for benthic algae in lakes was -26 , whereas that for riverine benthic algae was -29 . The greater water turbulence to which planktonic algae are exposed is known to dramatically reduce boundary layer thickness and was found to cause even more severe 13C depletion, resulting in an average value of -32 . This same effect also operates in coastal environments where the average delta13C value for marine phytoplankton was -22 compared to -17 for marine benthic algae. When comparisons were made on an individual study basis, differences of 10 or greater in delta13C were observed between planktonic and benthic algae in both oceans and lakes. These algal differences in delta13C were found to be substantial enough to be reflected in the delta13C values of consumers in marine coastal environments.},

However, body size has substantial effects on processes that affect competitive relationships between species: (i) small, recently recruited fish, which usually(?) suffer high mortality, can dominate total abundance and strongly influence the dynamics of the relative total abundances of different species, while having little effect on interspecific biomass relations; (ii) numeric abundance and biomass of a species can vary independently, due to habitat variation in population size-structure resulting from variation in mortality and growth, as well as habitat selection; and (iii) population size-structure affects the potential for and outcome of interspecific competition due to (a) ontogenetic change in types of resources used, (b) levels of resource needs being dependent on individual and species biomass rather than numbers, (c) advantages due to large size in behavioural contests, (d) variation in population size-structure being linked to habitat preference, which affects expression of competitive dominance, and (e) size dependency in the development of interspecific resource-sharing relationships. Assemblage-level analyses that ignore such size effects may fail to detect important effects of interspecific interactions.},

We studied movements of fantail (Etheostoma flabellare), riverweed (E. podostemone), and Roanoke darters (Percina roanoka) through two stream systems during two summers. We then related movement to variability in measured habitat attributes using logistic regression and exploratory data plots. We indexed habitat conditions at both microhabitat (i.e., patches of uniform depth, velocity, and substrate) and mesohabitat (i.e., riffle and pool channel units) spatial scales, and determined how local habitat conditions were affected by landscape spatial (i.e., longitudinal position, land use) and temporal contexts. Most spatial variability in habitat conditions and fish movement was unexplained by a site's location on the landscape. Exceptions were microhabitat diversity, which was greater in the less-disturbed watershed, and riffle isolation and predator density in pools, which were greater at more-downstream sites. Habitat conditions and movement also exhibited only minor temporal variability, but the relative influences of habitat attributes on movement were quite variable over time. During the first year, movements of fantail and riverweed darters were triggered predominantly by loss of shallow microhabitats; whereas, during the second year, microhabitat diversity was more strongly related (though in opposite directions) to movement of these two species. Roanoke darters did not move in response to microhabitat-scale variables, presumably because of the species' preference for deeper microhabitats that changed little over time. Conversely, movement of all species appeared to be constrained by riffle isolation and predator density in pools, two mesohabitat-scale attributes. Relationships between environmental variability and movement depended on both the spatiotemporal scale of consideration and the ecology of the species. Future studies that integrate across scales, taxa, and life-histories are likely to provide greater insight into movement ecology than will traditional, single-season, single-species approaches.},

Benthic samples were collected from the River Sp{\"o}l prior to the initial flood (1999) and at periodic intervals before and after eight floods from 2000 through 2002. Three artificial floods occurred each in 2000 and 2001, and two floods were implemented in 2002. We also sampled macroinvertebrates in an adjacent tributary (Val da l'Aqua) on the same dates as in the Sp{\"o}l to assess the natural temporal variability in assemblage structure. The regulated baseflow discharge in the Sp{\"o}l was {$<$}2.5 m3/s, whereas the floods ranged from 10 m3/s to over 25 m3/s with some flood peaks reaching {$>$}40 m3/s for a short period. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that the floods significantly reduced macroinvertebrate densities in the Sp{\"o}l, although recovery to pre-flood densities occurred within a matter of weeks to densities found in 1999. A principal components analysis revealed that assemblage composition shifted in response to the recurring floods, first from 1999 to 2000 and then from 2000 to 2001/2. Taxa that decreased in abundance due to the floods included the Gammaridae (Gammarus fossarum) and Turbellaria (Crenobia alpina). Taxa that increased in abundance included Baetidae, Chironomidae, and Simuliidae. Some Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Heptageniidae that were negatively impacted by the floods in 2000, subsequently increased in abundance. Our data suggest that the response of macroinvertebrates to experimental floods occurs over a period of years rather than months, as species composition adjusts to the new and more variable habitat template. Future changes are expected as additional species begin to colonize the river from adjacent sources. The results clearly show that the experimental flood regime should be maintained if resource managers wish to sustain the development of a more natural macroinvertebrate assemblage.},

  abstract = {The "restricted-movement paradigm" (RMP) states that adult fish in streams are sedentary and spend most of their lives in short (20-50 m) reaches of stream. In mark-recapture studies, however, many fish initially marked are often never recaptured. As well, turnover rates of individuals in the home section (where fish were originally marked) can be high when marked fish moving out are rapidly replaced by unmarked ones. Recent challenges to the RMP have been based on the inference that high turnover indicates high mobility. However, when the home section is small many individuals may leave (high turnover) but not move far away (low displacement). I present two models for the frequency distribution of displacement distances: one represents populations as homogeneous ensembles with a single mobility parameter; the second represents populations as a mixture of stationary and mobile individuals. Both readily distinguish the turnover and displacement components of movement and show that high turnover rate is compatible with low displacement. The models were then fit to dispersal curves for six species of stream salmonids in 27 populations. Empirical estimates of turnover rate were high (median: 0.53), variable among populations (range: 0.15-0.78), but unrelated to displacement distance. Median displacement was {$<$}100 m for 24 populations and was typically {$<$}50 m. The proportion of mobile individuals was low in most populations (median: 19\%) and exceeded 50\% in only five of the populations. Brook trout, a species central to studies critical of the RMP, appeared to be exceptionally mobile relative to other salmonids. The compatibility of high turnover rates with short displacement distances and the finding that median displacement was usually limited support the notion that restricted movement is the norm in populations of stream salmonids during nonmigratory periods. However, the finding of considerable intra- and interspecific heterogeneity in the extent of movement underscores the potential importance of the mobile component to population processes. By providing an analytical framework that yields quantitative measures of different components of movement and allows for standardized comparisons, these models can bring needed rigor to analysis and design in movement studies.},

  abstract = {Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner--recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner--recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {In this study I review the literature on resource partitioning in fish assemblages from 1940-83. Studies are grouped into seven global habitats: tropical reefs, temperate reefs, coastal marine, the Antarctic, mesopelagic/slope environments and freshwater streams and lakes. Freshwater systems first attracted the interest of resource ecologists; however, the number of studies of assemblages in all global habitats has risen sharply in the last decade. Studies treating single fish families show that resource partitioning occurs along more resource axes in more diverse assemblages. Unlike terrestrial systems, trophic separation is more important than habitat separation in fish assemblages. Based on 37 studies which concurrently examined habitat, food and temporal axes, 32\% showed primary separation by habitat, 57\% showed the greatest separation by food and 11\% showed temporal separation to be most important. Global habitat differences in the importance of major resource axes are difficult to determine because of sampling bias; however, fish assemblages in most habitats show approximately equal importance of separation along spatial and trophic dimensions. The exceptions are marine systems, especially temperate marine reef assemblages which show greater importance of trophic separation. Global habitat differences in the amount of resource partitioning are not apparent, given the level of resolution of this study. Assemblages from all habitats show rather high separation of coexisting species along at least one resource dimension. The degree of taxonomic relatedness varies significantly over assemblages from the seven major global habitats. Investigation of tropical reef fish assemblages and also stream fish assemblages, has focused on more closely related faunas than studies of assemblages from other habitats. The degree of relatedness has a significant effect on ecological separation for both congeneric-confamilial and confamilial-conordinal species pairs, with less related pairs showing greater differences in resource use. Comparisons of niche overlap between assemblages of different taxonomic structure will thus be biased by historical effects. Unlike habitat or trophic partitioning, temporal partitioning was significantly more important in less related species pairs so that temporal partitioning, at least to a major degree, may reflect historical effects, rather than coevolution within a particular community. Few studies have attempted to deal with most or all life history stages of species in an assemblage so that our knowledge of resource partitioning is biased toward late juvenile to adult stages. The inclusion of more life history stages, the control (or awareness) of biases due to historical effects or sampling design and a more experimental approach will be important components of future studies of resource partitioning.},

  abstract = {A model is developed to predict evolution in a population which contains a variety of ecologically specialized phenotypes. Individuals of each phenotype are assumed to specialize on a specific region of a resource axis present in the environment. The model, incorporating density-dependent effects on the fitness of the various phenotypes, predicts the number of individuals of each phenotype through time for both asexually and sexually reproducing populations. The lizard species, Anolis roquet, illustrates the kind of population treated by the model. The resource axis is prey size; small lizards preferentially utilize small prey, while large lizards exploit large prey. Field data on this species are used to estimate some of the parameters of the model. The model shows that there is an optimum number of individuals of each phenotype for a given set of resources and a given regime of interphenotypic competition. If the population has this optimum distribution of individuals, then the fitnesses of all phenotypes are equal and the largest population size is achieved. Any other distribution yields too many individuals of certain kinds and too few of others, and a smaller total population size. The model is solved analytically to characterize this optimum distribution thoroughly. The model also shows that an asexually reproducing population, provided it has enough genetic variability, attains the optimum distribution very rapidly, while a sexually reproducing population attains the optimum distribution only slowly if at all. As a result, the sexual population often suffers from overcrowding in some phenotypic classes and undercrowding in others, and has a lower population size. The reason a sexual population may not attain the optimum distribution is that there is always a direct relationship between the shape of the distribution of phenotypes in the whole population and the shape of the distribution of phenotypes among the offspring of each mating within the population. In particular, the variance in the population's phenotype distribution is always approximately twice the variance in the offspring phenotype distribution. Therefore, if a sexual population is to attain the optimum population distribution, its offspring distribution must have a certain shape. Natural selection will mold the offspring distribution to this special shape, but presumably this molding takes a very long time. If this is true, a sexual population in a new or changed environment attains the optimum population phenotype distribution much more slowly than an asexual population. The niche width of a population is the length of the interval on the resource axis from which the population obtains most (say 95\%) of its resources. There are two components to niche width: the within-phenotype component, which is due to the variety of resources used by each phenotype, and the between-phenotype component, which is due to the population's having a variety of phenotypes. The model summarized above concerns the evolution in asexual and sexual populations of the between-phenotype component of niche width. Also, an expression is derived which partitions niche width into the within-phenotype and between-phenotype components such that the total niche width is simply the sum of measures for these two components. Ecological release is an expansion in niche width by a population which originated in a packed fauna and which has newly colonized an open environment. A population may undergo release in either the within-phenotype or between-phenotype components of niche width or both. Because asexual populations attain the optimum population distribution of phenotypes more rapidly than do sexual populations, asexual ones have a greater potency for release in the between-phenotype component. This claim seems an important explanation for the colonizing ability of asexual species. The process of faunal buildup on an island is a race between a widening of the offspring phenotype distribution of the first species there and dispersion to the island by members of some other ecologically differentiated species. If the widening of the offspring phenotype distribution, and hence the niche width, is slow enough, vacant regions exist on the resource axis which facilitate establishment of emigrants from elsewhere. In plants, an alternative to achieving ecological release by widening the offspring phenotype distribution is to develop self-compatibility.}

However, invertebrates from the most heavily shaded stream site were unusually enriched in 13C. An undetected carbon source of terrestrial origin, perhaps 13C-enriched dissolved organic carbon in groundwater, may have been contributing indirectly to invertebrate biomass carbon. 4 {$\sigma$}13C values for fish were not closely linked to aquatic invertebrate ratios; instead, at all sites their carbon was isotopically similar to terrestrial organic carbon. The reasons for this apparent anomaly are unclear.},

  abstract = {Energy metabolism fuels swimming and other biological processes. We compared the swimming performance and energy metabolism within and across eight freshwater fish species. Using swim tunnel respirometers, we measured the standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and calculated the critical swimming speed (Ucrit). We accounted for body size, metabolic traits, and some morphometric ratios in an effort to understand the extent and underlying causes of variation. Body mass was largely the best predictor of swimming capacity and metabolic traits within species. Moreover, we found that predictive models using total length or SMR, in addition to body mass, significantly increased the explained variation of Ucrit and MMR in certain fish species. These predictive models also underlined that, once body mass has been accounted for, Ucrit can be independently affected by total length or MMR. This study exemplifies the utility of multiple regression models to assess within-species variability. At interspecific level, our results showed that variation in Ucrit can partly be explained by the variation in the interrelated traits of MMR, fineness, and muscle ratios. Among the species studied, bleak Alburnus alburnus performed best in terms of swimming performance and efficiency. By contrast, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus showed very poor swimming performance, but attained lower mass-specific cost of transport (MCOT) than some rheophilic species, possibly reflecting a cost reduction strategy to compensate for hydrodynamic disadvantages. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the key factors influencing the swimming performance of fish at both intra- and interspecific levels.},

  abstract = {Stable coexistence of ecologically identical species is not possible according to the established ecological theory. Many coexistence mechanisms have been proposed, but they all involve some form of ecological differentiation among the competing species. The aggregation model of coexistence would predict coexistence of identical species if there would be a mechanism that generates spatially aggregated distributions that are not completely correlated among the species. Our aim is to demonstrate that continued dispersal, triggered by reproductive interference between ecologically identical species, is such a mechanism. This study has been motivated by species using ephemeral patchy resources, such as decomposing fruits, fungal sporophores, carrion, and dung. We analyse an individual-based model with sexual reproduction, in which the progeny develops in ephemeral resource patches and the new generation disperses to a new set of patches. We assume spatially restricted dispersal, that patches differ in detectability, and that unmated females continue dispersal. In the model, reproductive interference (males spend some time searching for and/or attempting to mate with heterospecific females) reduces the mating rate of females, especially in the less common species, which leads to increased dispersal and reduces spatial correlation in species' distributions. For a wide range of parameter values, coexisting species show a systematic difference in their relative abundances due to two opposing forces: (1) uncommon species have reduced growth rate (Allee effect), which decreases abundance; (2) an abundance difference between the species reduces interspecific spatial correlation, which in turn reduces interspecific competition and allows the rarer species to persist at low density. Our results demonstrate a new mechanism for coexistence that is not based on ecological differentiation between species.},

We used 6 years of data combining tagging, mobile antenna tracking and recaptures of Salmo trutta in multiple small streams in the Lake Lucerne drainage area in Switzerland to evaluate the relative importance of different environmental and intrinsic factors affecting the efficiency of the method. Our study system and experimental design allowed us to accurately verify the continuous presence and survival of recaptured fish in the stream after tracking, which meant that we could estimate detection probability with high confidence. The mean detection probability of tagged trout was 43\%, but we found that fish length had a strong negative effect on detection probability, especially in males. Multivariate axes of stream environmental features did not predict efficiency but stream width alone was significantly positively correlated with efficiency. Additionally, stream temperature when tracking had a positive effect on fish detectability. Tag loss at recapture was globally rare ({$<$}8\%) but common in large postspawn females ({$>$}30\%). Based on the escape response of fish after detection, we could estimate the proportion of ghost tags, which reached a plateau of around 80\% 2 years after tagging. We finally showed that our models of tag loss, fish detection and escape response are needed to interpret detection events. Our results highlight that individual variation in detection probability and tag loss is high and has to be considered for analysis.},

To make comparisons across studies using different methods, the degree to which fin clips and dorsal muscle are correlated for both {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C across time and space must be quantified. We evaluated the efficacy of using caudal fin clips by comparing tissues collected across time (2003-2005), space (21 streams), and body size (fork length, 40-140 mm) for juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. mykiss (rainbow trout and steelhead [anadromous rainbow trout]).

We found that the relationship between fin and muscle tissue was consistent across years and streams. On average, {$\delta$}15N was lower in fin tissue than in muscle tissue, whereas {$\delta$}13C was greater in fin tissue. Although the magnitude of the difference between fin and muscle tissue is lower than the thresholds typically used to define trophic level increases, the biological significance of these differences is context dependent. Power analyses indicated that fin and muscle tissue were equal in their ability to detect differences in {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C in juvenile fish and that larger sample sizes are needed to statistically quantify these differences. Finally, the use of fin clips is not a viable option for smaller fish (\&lt;50 mm) because the majority of the caudal fin is necessary for analysis. Nonetheless, fin clipping does represent a promising nonlethal sampling technique for quantifying {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C in juvenile salmonids.},

Here we quantified the extent to which a manipulative parasite altered the flow of energy through a forest-stream ecosystem. In a Japanese headwater stream, camel crickets and grasshoppers (Orthoptera) were 20 times more likely to enter a stream if infected by a nematomorph parasite (Gordionus spp.), corroborating evidence that nematomorphs manipulate their hosts to seek water where the parasites emerge as free-living adults. Endangered Japanese trout (Salvelinus leucomaenis japonicus) readily ate these infected orthopterans, which due to their abundance, accounted for 60\% of the annual energy intake of the trout population. Trout grew fastest in the fall, when nematomorphs were driving energy-rich orthopterans into the stream. When infected orthopterans were available, trout did not eat benthic invertebrates in proportion to their abundance, leading to the potential for cascading, indirect effects through the forest-stream ecosystem. These results provide the first quantitative evidence that a manipulative parasite can dramatically alter the flow of energy through and across ecosystems.},

Consumer populations are commonly stage-structured and may respond to the subsidies differently among the stages yet less is known about how this might impact the subsidy effects on the strength of trophic cascades in recipient systems. We show here, using a large-scale field experiment, that the stage structure of a recipient consumer would dampen the effects of terrestrial invertebrate subsidies on the strength of trophic cascade in streams. When a high input rate of the terrestrial invertebrates was available, both large and small fish stages switched their diet to the terrestrial subsidy, which weakened the trophic cascade in streams. However, when the input rate of the terrestrial invertebrates was at a moderate level, the terrestrial subsidy did not weaken the trophic cascade. This discrepancy was likely due to small fish stages being competitively excluded from feeding on the subsidy by larger stages of fish and primarily foraging on benthic invertebrates under the moderate input level. Although previous studies using single fish stages have clearly demonstrated that the terrestrial invertebrate input equivalent to our moderate input rate weakened the trophic cascade in streams, this subsidy effect might be overestimated given small fish stage may not switch their diet to the subsidy under competition with large fish stage. Given the ubiquity of consumer stage structure and interaction among consumer stages, the effects we saw might be widespread in nature, requiring future studies that explicitly involve consumer's stage structure into community ecology.},

  abstract = {Survival is often estimated from capture--recapture data using Cormack--Jolly--Seber (CJS) models, where mortality and emigration cannot be distinguished, and the estimated apparent survival probability is the product of the probabilities of true survival and of study area fidelity. Consequently, apparent survival is lower than true survival unless study area fidelity equals one. Underestimation of true survival from capture--recapture data is a main limitation of the method. We develop a spatial version of the CJS model that allows estimation of true survival. Besides the information about whether a specific individual was encountered at a given occasion, it is often recorded where the encounter occurred. Thus, information is available about the fraction of dispersal that occurs within the study area, and we use it to model dispersal and estimate true survival. Our model is formulated hierarchically and consists of survival, dispersal and observation submodels, assuming that encounters are possible anywhere within a study area. In a simulation study, our new spatial CJS model produced accurate estimates of true survival and dispersal behaviour for various sizes and shapes of the study area, even if emigration is substantial. However, when the information about dispersal is scarce due to low survival, low recapture probabilities and high emigration, the estimators are positively biased. Moreover, survival estimates are sensitive to the assumed dispersal kernel. We applied the spatial CJS model to a data set of adult red-backed shrikes (Lanius collurio). Apparent survival of males (c. 0{$\cdot$}5) estimated with the CJS model was larger than in females (c. 0{$\cdot$}4), but the application of the spatial CJS model revealed that both sexes had similar survival probabilities (c. 0{$\cdot$}6). The mean breeding dispersal distance in females was c. 700 m, while males dispersed only c. 250 m between years. Spatial CJS models enable study of dispersal and survival independent of study design constraints such as imperfect detection and size of the study area provided that some of the dispersing individuals remain in the study area. We discuss possible extensions of our model: alternative dispersal models and the inclusion of covariates and of a habitat suitability map.},

  abstract = {Organismal movement is ubiquitous and facilitates important ecological mechanisms that drive community and metacommunity composition and hence biodiversity. In most existing ecological theories and models in biodiversity research, movement is represented simplistically, ignoring the behavioural basis of movement and consequently the variation in behaviour at species and individual levels. However, as human endeavours modify climate and land use, the behavioural processes of organisms in response to these changes, including movement, become critical to understanding the resulting biodiversity loss. Here, we draw together research from different subdisciplines in ecology to understand the impact of individual-level movement processes on community-level patterns in species composition and coexistence. We join the movement ecology framework with the key concepts from metacommunity theory, community assembly and modern coexistence theory using the idea of micro--macro links, where various aspects of emergent movement behaviour scale up to local and regional patterns in species mobility and mobile-link-generated patterns in abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. These in turn influence both individual movement and, at ecological timescales, mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, and niche partitioning. We conclude by highlighting challenges to and promising future avenues for data generation, data analysis and complementary modelling approaches and provide a brief outlook on how a new behaviour-based view on movement becomes important in understanding the responses of communities under ongoing environmental change.},

  abstract = {The stream continuum concept suggests that the physical structure of the stream channel coupled with the hydrological cycle and energy inputs results in a consistent pattern of community structure and function along a stream. I evaluated this concept in a headwater fish community along two physical gradient gradients: upstream to downstream and riffle to pool. Habitat diversity and volume increased from upstream to downstream, and from riffle to pool. Temporal variation in habitat diversity was greater upstream. Upstream, and in riffles, habitat volume tended to vary more with time. Fluctuations in rainfall regime caused annual variation in habitat, especially in volume. Benthic insect density was highest from autumn (October-November) through spring (May-June). Following emergence of adults in late spring, invertebrate densities were low in summer in areas with riparian vegetation, but were not lower where riparian vegetation was absent and stable substrates were present. Along a gradient of substrates from silt-sand to gravel-rock, insect production increased, as indicated by adults and pupae in the drift. Peak resource availability for insectivore-piscivore fishes occurred in late summer and autumn, due to increased abundance of young-of-the-year fish. Pool and raceway-pool habitat guilds and insectivore and insectivore-piscivore trophic guilds contained the largest number of species. Increases in species richness were primarily associated with the addition of deeper habitats. Species richness of the pool insectivore-piscivore guild was especially variable over time. Biomass in shallow areas consisted predominantly of generalized insectivores. In deep, stable habitats, generalized insectivores were replaced as the predominant trophic group by insectivore-piscivores and large benthic insectivores. Immigration of fish occurred in spring and autumn, the periods of highest resource availability. Immigration between midriver and headwater regions primarily involved older age classes (III+), and was associated with changes in flow regime, habitat structure, and seasonal dynamics of the resource base of particular trophic groups. Flow regime and habitat volume appeared to be important factors limiting immigration in autumn, especially in pool species. Habitat diversity (depth, current, and substrate; DCS) was significantly correlated with fish species diversity (FSD). However, considerable variation occurred in the relationship between the two variables, including: (1) FSD decreased in winter in shallow, less diverse habitats due to emigration, and increased in spring due to recolonization; (2) FSD increased in spring and autumn when resource availability increased; (3) FSD was least predictable from DCS in autumn, when flow regimes were low and large numbers of fish recruits were present; and (4) DCS did not predict FSD as accurately in temporally variable upstream areas where large numbers of small fish dominated the community, especially in areas with human disturbance. Young age groups (0-II) were primarily found in shallow, temporally variable areas upstream and in riffles. Relative growth rates were highest during summer months. However, growth rates did not increase as much between spring and summer as would have been predicted from the seasonal increase in water temperature, suggesting that resource limitation may have occurred during summer periods. Centrarchids had substantially higher growth rates than cyprinids during early life stages. Net production for age 0-II fish was highest in upstream and riffle areas because of high densities of young, generalized insectivores. Net production of insectivore-piscivores was highest in downstream and pool habitats. Development of large, stable pools and raceways resulted in decreased fish production due to shifts in age structure toward fewer, large individuals with slower relative growth rates (age III+). Temporal variation in reproductive success and survival of younger age groups (0-I) was associated with random variation in high flow regimes and appeared to be a major factor determining spatial and temporal variation in production. These patterns of fish community structure and function support the qualitative aspect of the stream continuum concept: consistent shifts in community organization are associated with spatial or temporal changes in channel morphology and resource availability. However, for the stream continuum concept to be useful as a quantitative predictor, the ultimate mechanism(s) regulating fish community organization need to be more rigorously established. I hypothesize that in upstream or riffle areas, where younger age classes predominate, recolonization dynamics, the effect of gradual changes in physical conditions on competitive interactions, and temporal variation in reproductive success, are more important than competitive exclusion and predation as determinants of community organization.},

Competition was found in 90\% of the studies and 76\% of their species, indicating its pervasive importance in ecological systems. Exploitative competition and interference competition were apparent mechanisms about equally often. Few experiments showed year-to-year variation in the existence of competition, though more did in its intensity; many were not long-term. The Hairston-Slobodkin-Smith hypothesis concerning variation in the importance of competition between trophic levels was strongly supported for terrestrial and freshwater systems. In particular, producers, and granivores, nectarivores, carnivores, and scavengers taken together, showed more competition than did phytophagous herbivores and filter feeders. In marine systems, virtually no trend was detectable one way or the other. Large heterotrophs competed more than small ones in most comparisons, and other properties possibly deterring predation, such as stinging behavior, seemed also characteristic of species competing frequently. Among terrestrial plants and certain terrestrial animals but not all, experiments carried out in enclosures were more likely to show competition than unenclosed experiments. A greater ecological overlap implied a greater tendency to compete, as determined experimentally, when niche dimensions were food type or microhabitat; the opposite was true for macrohabitat. A substantial number of studies showed asymmetry in their species' response to competition; larger species were significantly more often superior than smaller ones, though a variety of other apparent reasons for asymmetry also existed. The integration of competition theory into field experimentation has only just begun.},

Four females resident in a large (13 shells) male territory were given the opportunity to stay there or to emigrate to another large (13 shells) or a small (four shells) male territory. In six replicates we found that (1) the most aggressive females had the largest subterritories (most shells); (2) invariably, the two females with the fewest shells emigrated; (3) both the emigrating and the staying females had more shells after emigration than before.

However, the potential response to altered patterns of connectivity in a changing climate remain poorly understood, particularly in regard to vulnerable systems such as Arctic deltaic lakes. Here, we present the first study to examine the metacommunity structure of aquatic invertebrates in a major Arctic floodplain system (Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories). We sampled macroinvertebrate communities across the longitudinal span of the Delta and used three complementary analyses (variance partitioning, elements of metacommunity structure, and fourth corner analysis) to determine the relative influence of environmental versus spatial variation, metacommunity structure across dispersal modes, and the functional metacommunity structure. Environmental factors explained the most variation (23\%) compared to spatial factors (2\%) or environmental/spatial covariance (4\%). Functional structure was primarily related to macroinvertebrate dispersal mode and lake isolation, with distributions of aerial dispersers determined mainly by environmental factors and aquatic dispersers by both dispersal limitation and environmental factors. We attribute these results to the inter-lake mixing effects of annual flooding and the lack of barriers to aerial dispersal, and discuss how a loss of aquatic invertebrate biodiversity could result from projected climate-mediated alterations to ice jam dynamics in the Delta.},

Deterministic exclusions reduce both patch-scale richness and beta-diversity, thereby homogenising the community. Stochastic extinctions reduce richness at the patch scale, but increase the differences in species composition among patches. These results indicate that studies of competitive effects on beta diversity may help to distinguish between deterministic and stochastic components of competitive exclusion.

However, the mechanisms that allow palatable salamanders to coexist with fish are unknown.                            2.{\enspace}We tested mechanisms in the field that promote coexistence between Idaho giant salamanders (               Dicamptodon aterrimus               ) and stream salmonid fishes in headwater streams. Previous research in this system indicated that salamander dispersal did not promote coexistence with fish. We tested the hypothesis that               D.~aterrimus               shift their diet when they occur with fish, facilitating coexistence through local niche partitioning.                                         3.{\enspace}We used nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes to describe the trophic niche of               D.~aterrimus               and fish in three co-occurring populations of salamanders and fish and three populations of salamanders without fish. We used two approaches to quantify trophic niche partitioning with stable isotopes: 95\% kernel density estimators and isotopic mixing models.                          4.{\enspace}We found that salamanders and fish were generalists that consumed aquatic invertebrates primarily, but both species were also cannibalistic and predatory on one another. We also found no support for trophic niche partitioning as a coexistence mechanism because there were no differences in the trophic niche metrics among salamander populations with and without fish.             5.{\enspace}Although we did not identify mechanisms that facilitate salamander and fish coexistence, our empirical data and use of novel approaches to describe the trophic niche did yield important insights on the role of predator--prey interactions and cannibalism as alternative coexistence mechanisms.

  abstract = {Animal movement comes in a variety of `types' including small foraging movements, larger one-way dispersive movements, seasonally-predictable round-trip migratory movements, and erratic nomadic movements. Although most individuals move at some point throughout their lives, movement patterns can vary widely across individuals within the same species: differing within an individual over time (intra-individual), among individuals in the same population (inter-individual), or among populations (inter-population). Yet, studies of movement (theoretical and empirical alike) more often focus on understanding `typical' movement patterns than understanding variation in movement. Here, I synthesize current knowledge of movement variation (drawing parallels across species and movement types), describing the causes (what factors contribute to individual variation), patterns (what movement variation looks like), consequences (why variation matters), maintenance (why variation persists), implications (for management and conservation), and finally gaps (what pieces we are currently missing). By synthesizing across scales of variation, I span across work on plasticity, personality, and geographic variation. Individual movement can be driven by factors that act at the individual, population, community and ecosystem level and have ramifications at each of these levels. Generally the consequences of movement are less well understood than the causes, in part because the effects of movement variation are often nested, with variation manifesting at the population level, which in turn affects communities and ecosystems. Understanding both cause and consequence is particularly important for predicting when variation begets variation in a positive feedback loop, versus when a negative feedback causes variation to be dampened successively. Finally, maintaining standing variation in movement may be important for facilitating species' ability to respond to future environmental change.},

Data on changes in the physical character of the stream, the fish population, and the bottom food supply also are presented for 1 year before and 3 years after installation of deflectors. The methods used to measure these various changes are given. Installation of 24 pool-forming deflectors raised the number of good pools from 9 to 29, increased the average pool depth by 6 inches, and exposed additional gravel without significantly changing the average stream depth over the entire section. Preliminary and unpublished bottom-food studies indicated a decrease in total number and volume of all organisms but an increase in forms found most frequently in trout stomachs. Fish-population studies demonstrated slight increases in the number of smaller trout present after the addition of deflectors, attended by a slight decrease in average size. Average creel-census figures for the 3 years prior to stream improvement and the 5 years after show an increase after improvement of 120 percent in the total catch and of 46 percent in pounds caught per hour coincident with a 64 percent increase in angling pressure. It was demonstrated that migration into the section improved was not responsible for the increases noted, also that bordering sections failed to have fishing comparably good to that produced in the improved section. It was concluded that the improvement in brook trout fishing in the experimental section was the result of an increase in number, size, and depth of pools created by installation of current deflectors.}

  abstract = {Physical habitat gradients in small rivers and streams profoundly influence aquatic community structure. These ecosystems are critical for biodiversity conservation, serving as refugia and nurseries for numerous species. Effective freshwater conservation necessitates tailored strategies addressing specific anthropogenic pressures and each habitat type's unique geomorphological and hydrological characteristics. This study examined the response of fish communities to habitat heterogeneity and channelization in small rivers and streams within the Drawa River catchment, Pomerania, northwestern Poland. The interaction of morphohydrochemical characteristics created distinct spatial patterns within the catchment. Critical physical habitat characteristics significantly influencing fish community structure were identified through Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Aquatic macrophyte coverage showed a negative relationship with both fish biomass and abundance in the catchment. Habitat diversity, mediated by physical factors and their interactions, significantly influences the fish community in the catchment. More abundant species have a greater impact on beta diversity patterns, while sites with fewer fish often have unique fish communities. This study underscores the importance of prioritizing rivers with simplified substrates and anthropogenic modifications for conservation and restoration efforts. Furthermore, sites lacking fish populations warrant consideration in conservation planning. Optimal reconstruction strategies to mitigate anthropogenic impacts may include enhancing substrate complexity, removing obstructions, constructing fish passages, and reconfiguring channels. In-stream habitat improvement emerges as the primary strategy for protecting side channels in temperate lowland catchments.},

Although these assembly processes act in concert to structure local communities, their relative importance is considerably variable among study systems. While such contingency of community assembly has been widely appreciated, the empirical and theoretical evidence is scattered around in the literature, and few efforts have been made to synthesize it. In this mini-review, we summarize the accumulated evidence of the context-dependency of community assembly rules, to reach a rough generalization of the contingency. Specifically, we argue that spatial and temporal dimensions can serve as general axes that regulate the relative importance of assembly processes. To this end, we synthesize the current understanding of how the relative importance of multiple assembly processes changes with spatial scales and complexity, and with time in the long and short terms. This review concludes that spatial and temporal dimensions can be common currencies of community assembly rules that are shared across various systems.},

  abstract = {We consider four categories or biological mechanisms of determinants which cause and maintain species diversity: niche relations, habitat diversity, mass effects and ecological equivalency. Two of these determinants are original to this paper: mass effect, the establishment of species in sites where they cannot be self-maintaining; and ecological equivalency, the coexistence of species with effectively identical niche and habitat requirements. The mode of action and ecological implications of each biological determinant are discussed using a schematic method for measuring alpha (community), beta (differentiation), and gamma (regional) diversities. The importance of mass effects and ecological equivalency to species richess is documented with several types of field data from Israel and California, U.S.A. Floristic richness and, in particular, the richness of floristic transitions, are discussed and interpreted by use of the biological determinants of diversity. Contact transition between distinct floras are rich predominantly because of mass effects. Transitions induced by marked environmental changes are rich because of the combined influences of habitat diversity and mass effects. The rate at which species richness increases with sample area is related to the combined effects of all four biological determinants. This complexity explains the failures of simple species-area models. The relative intensity of each determinant is related to area: niche relations are most important at within-community scales, habitat diversity most important at both within-community and landscape scales, and ecological equivalency most important at regional scales. We suggest that understanding patterns of species diversity will be enhanced by the partitioning of total species richness into the richness caused by each of the four ecologically distinct determinants of diversity.},

Traditional sensitivity analyses can struggle to identify the nonlinearities and interactions emergent from such complexity, especially across broad swaths of parameter space. This limits understanding of the ecological mechanisms underlying model behavior. Machine learning approaches are a potential answer to this issue, given their predictive ability when applied to complex large datasets. While perceptions that machine learning is a ``black box'' linger, we seek to illuminate its interpretive potential in ecological modeling. To do so, we detail our process of applying random forests to complex model dynamics to produce both high predictive accuracy and elucidate the ecological mechanisms driving our predictions. Specifically, we employ an empirically rooted ontogenetically stage-structured consumer-resource simulation model. Using simulation parameters as feature inputs and simulation output as dependent variables in our random forests, we extended feature analyses into a simple graphical analysis from which we reduced model behavior to three core ecological mechanisms. These ecological mechanisms reveal the complex interactions between internal plant demography and trophic allocation driving community dynamics while preserving the predictive accuracy achieved by our random forests.},

The mean distance moved each month was positively correlated with monthly stream discharge, but the direction of movements was unpredictable. Patterns of movement varied considerably among individuals and appeared to be unrelated to size. Cod established home ranges of between 70 and 820\,m in length. Five of the tagged cod returned to a previous home range after moving more than 10\,km, whereas three did not move more than 2\,km from their capture location for the duration of the study. Cod used large woody debris complexes more than any other type of habitat, and rarely used areas of open water. Managers should give high priority to maintenance of fish passage and protection/rehabilitation of large woody debris habitats if cod populations are to recover.},

We tested this hypothesis with a unique data set sampled identically in 200 streams in two regions (tropical Brazil and boreal Finland) that differ in macroinvertebrate community size by fivefold. Null models allowed us to estimate the magnitude to which {$\beta$}-diversity deviates from the expectation under a random assembly process while taking differences in richness and relative abundance into account, i.e., {$\beta$}-deviation. We found that both abundance- and incidence-based {$\beta$}-diversity was negatively related to community size only in Brazil. Also, {$\beta$}-diversity of small tropical communities was closer to stochastic expectations compared with {$\beta$}-diversity of large communities. We suggest that ecological drift may drive variation in some small communities by changing the expected outcome of niche selection, increasing the chances of species with low abundance and narrow distribution to occur in some communities. Habitat destruction, overexploitation, pollution, and reductions in connectivity have been reducing the size of biological communities. These environmental pressures might make smaller communities more vulnerable to novel conditions and render community dynamics more unpredictable. Incorporation of community size into ecological models should provide conceptual and applied insights into a better understanding of the processes driving biodiversity.},

Using data from two sets of behavioral experiments examining stream minnows (bluehead chubs) foraging in the presence of sunfish predators (green sunfish), we assess, via statistical model fitting, the utility of four basic optimization models of foraging behavior. Our analysis of feeding and mortality of the minnows indicates that mortality is incurred so as to feed above maintenance requirements, that feeding rate is suppressed in response to the presence of predators, and that the balance of feeding against mortality can be estimated using a life-history parameter {\texttheta}, interpreted theoretically as the marginal rate of substitution of mortality rate for growth rate. Our results indicate that both body size and age are probably involved in determining the value of {\texttheta}, and we suggest that future studies should focus on estimating and understanding this parameter.},

  abstract = {Using a mark--recapture technique in a small temperate stream, we described the movement of four fish species over a five-month period and developed a mathematical model that described the observed movement patterns. The movement distributions were generally leptokurtic, and two of the four species demonstrated some degree of upstream bias. There was little difference in movement among species or through time. There were no temporal correlations in probability of movement, movement direction, or distance moved. The spatial spread of the most abundant species, bluehead chubs, over a four-month period was characterized by upstream bias, diffusion-like spread, and persistent leptokurtosis. Bluehead chubs demonstrated complex relationships between probability of movement and size and growth, while creek chubs showed only an effect of size on probability of movement. Further, growth of individual bluehead chubs was correlated through time. These empirical results suggest the hypothesis that heterogeneity in phenotypic attributes, such as size and growth, is related to heterogeneity in movement behavior. A diffusion--advection model of bluehead chub movement, structured with two subgroups that dispersed at different rates (``fast fish'' and ``slow fish''), was parameterized and validated with the field data. This model with heterogeneity in movement rates generated the leptokurtic pattern observed in the field data, in contrast to the classic diffusion model without population heterogeneity, which produces a normal distribution. The results from this work suggest that heterogeneity in fitness-influencing attributes such as size and growth could explain heterogeneity in individual-level movement behavior and might underlie the leptokurtic patterns that have been observed at the population level in numerous field studies.},

  abstract = {Rationale Stable isotope analysis (SIA) is a powerful tool for examining diet and food-web dynamics. SIA assumes ``you are what you eat'' relative to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). However, fractionation of carbon during lipid synthesis violates this assumption; high-lipid tissues do not reflect {$\delta$}13C values of diet and therefore have the potential to skew mixing model results and diet interpretations, making corrections necessary. Methods Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) white muscle and liver samples from several fish species representing the temperate North American cold- and warm-water fish community were corrected for lipids via chemical lipid extraction and mathematical lipid normalization. To assess the accuracy of model-predicted lipid-free {$\delta$}13C values calculated from four normalization models, we compared model-predicted values with those measured after lipid extraction. Results We found that chemical lipid extraction is unnecessary for Brook Trout white muscle tissue with low initial lipid content. However, in tissues with C:N ratios greater than 3.5, lipid extraction increased {$\delta$}13C values in fish liver by more than 1.0 ‰, indicating that liver lipid content is sufficient to bias {$\delta$}13C values. We also found that lipids were accurately accounted for with mathematical normalization and recommend that tissues with C:N ratios greater than 3.5 be corrected mathematically. Conclusions Our findings indicate that mathematical normalization is sufficient to account for bias in {$\delta$}13C values associated with lipid content in fish tissues when C:N ratios are above 3.5. C:N ratios below 3.5 indicate that tissues have insufficient levels of lipid to bias the {$\delta$}13C values. Generally, these findings support the use of more timely and cost-effective processing and analysis methods in future aquatic food-web studies utilizing SIA.

  abstract = {The use of passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags in ecological studies is increasingly common, but evaluations of their performance and range of application in the field are still emerging. Here, we compare habitat unit--scale abundance estimates of PIT-tagged juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and steelhead O. mykiss derived from multiple-pass surveys with a submersible pole-mounted PIT antenna and backpack electrofishing in a small coastal California stream. We found high concordance of methods for coho salmon and age-0 steelhead and moderate concordance for age-1 and older steelhead. Regression analysis of PIT antenna estimates on electrofishing estimates indicated an approximately one-to-one relationship between methods. Regression intercepts for coho salmon and age-0 steelhead were significantly greater than zero, but the differences were small (with an effect equivalent to less than one fish). We found no evidence that pool area, cover area, or cover complexity influenced the relationship between methods for coho salmon and age-0 steelhead, but some evidence that electrofishing may be more effective than PIT antennas for estimating the abundance of age-1 and older steelhead in pools with high cover complexity. Our results demonstrate that surveys using submersible PIT antennas can provide habitat unit--scale estimates of juvenile salmonid abundance similar to those derived from electrofishing in small streams. An advantage of using PIT antennas is that they allow fish abundance estimation without fish recapture and frequent sampling can occur without subjecting study animals to excessive handling stress or mortality. This is a particularly important consideration in studies of small populations, sensitive species, or fish listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

Lethal sampling can be undesirable when studying a species at risk such as lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). We evaluated the feasibility of using pectoral fin clips as an alternative to dorsal muscle tissue in stable isotope studies for adult lake sturgeon. Because lipid content can affect stable isotope ratios, we also determined whether lipid extraction and mathematical normalization affected the relationship between fin-clip and muscle tissue signatures. Dorsal muscle plugs and fin clips were collected from adult lake sturgeon and analyzed for stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Significant, positive relationships were observed between fin and muscle tissues for both {$\delta$}15N (r2=0.43) and {$\delta$}13C (r2=0.32). Lipid extraction significantly reduced the among-individual variation, and improved the {$\delta$}13C relationship significantly (r2=0.74). While general non-linear mathematical lipid normalization did effectively reduce the among-individual variation, a consistent enrichment relative to chemical extraction was observed. An alternative mass balance correction method, however, yielded lake sturgeon specific parameter estimates that facilitated accurate lipid correction. The strong relationships between fin-clip and muscle tissue signatures demonstrate that fin-clips should be considered as good surrogates for muscle tissue, will allow trophic studies to accurately adjust for the effect of differential lipid accumulation and can effectively limit the need for invasive sampling for adult lake sturgeon.},

  abstract = {The structure and function of streams is of critical importance to salmonid populations. The structure of streams is related to the amount and complexity of cover. Drift feeding salmonids use cover for a variety of reasons, but a primary reason is as velocity shelter. Fish choose focal positions near cover with low average velocities near stream regions with fast water velocities. Of all the variables that influence stream dwelling salmonids current velocity is considered to be of prime importance. Velocity is typically reported as average values, but riverene flows are turbulent for the vast majority of cases. Turbulence arises from shear on the bed and around large roughness elements, both regions preferentially occupied by young salmonids. The association between turbulence, cover and salmonid habitat occupancy provides an opportunity to use turbulence to better define habitat requirements. A combination of laboratory and field studies were conducted using high and low frequency velocity meters to document the turbulent velocity fluctuations at the focal point of young salmonids, their response to turbulent flow, and the relation between habitat complexity and habitat use. It was found that fish select focal points characterized by low turbulence, but that turbulence is a good predictor of the occurrence of young salmonids. These results appeared to be contradictory. Fish selected low turbulence focal positions, but selected focal positions near turbulence producing cover. This contradictory response was explained through the introduction of the turbulent attraction and avoidance (TAA) hypothesis. This hypothesis states that fish use turbulence produced from shear to navigate to locations in proximity to cover. Once there, focal positions are chosen that minimize exposure to turbulence produced from the cover. Another application of this work is in the field of hydraulic habitat modeling. Existing models do not predict potential focal positions or rearing densities with any consistency. Hydraulic habitat models are an important tool, and their use will likely increase. Therefore improvements in the ability of these models to realistically portray salmonid habitat use is critical, and the use of turbulence related habitat descriptions have the potential to improve the efficacy of these models.},

Although stream fishes may spend the majority of their time in a home pool, they also make regular exploratory trips away from the home pool. Recapture of Ouachita Highlands stream fish marked with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags showed that the majority of the uniquely marked fish in this study were in the pools of initial collection. The following percentages of marked fish were recaptured outside the pool of initial collection: 12\% of creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus; 33\% of blackspotted topminnow Fundulus olivaceus; 12\% of green sunfish Lepomis cyanellus; and 14\% of longear sunfish Lepomis megalotis. Standard lengths and weights did not differ significantly between nonmobile and mobile recaptured fish, and patterns of multiple recaptures indicated exploratory, round-trip movements. Such regular exploratory trips suggest that the area of use by and critical habitat for stream fishes may be greater than commonly estimated.},

Typically, macroecologists explain the large-scale patterns of abundance, distribution and diversity. Despite the difficulties in sampling and characterizing microbial diversity, macroecologists have recently also been interested in unicellular organisms. Here, I review the current advances made in microbial macroecology, as well as discuss related ecosystem functions. Overall, it seems that microorganisms suit surprisingly well to known species abundance distributions and show positive relationship between distribution and adundance. Microbial species--area and distance--decay relationships tend to be weaker than for macroorganisms, but nonetheless significant. Few findings on altitudinal gradients in unicellular taxa seem to differ greatly from corresponding findings for larger taxa, whereas latitudinal gradients among microorganisms have either been clearly evident or absent depending on the context. Literature also strongly emphasizes the role of spatial scale for the patterns of diversity and suggests that patterns are affected by species traits as well as ecosystem characteristics. Finally, I discuss the large role of local biotic and abiotic variables driving the community assembly in unicellular taxa and eventually dictating how multiple ecosystem processes are performed. Present review highlights the fact that most microorganisms may not differ fundamentally from larger taxa in their large-scale distribution patterns. Yet, review also shows that many aspects of microbial macroecology are still relatively poorly understood and specific patterns depend on focal taxa and ecosystem concerned.},

Commonly applied statistical tools cannot quantitatively estimate these processes, nor identify abiotic features that impose these processes. For interrogation of subsurface microbial communities distributed across two geologically distinct formations of the unconfined aquifer underlying the Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State, we developed an analytical framework that advances ecological understanding in two primary ways. First, we quantitatively estimate influences of Drift, Selection and Dispersal. Second, ecological patterns are used to characterize measured and unmeasured abiotic variables that impose Selection or that result in low levels of Dispersal. We find that (i) Drift alone consistently governs {$\sim$}25\% of spatial turnover in community composition; (ii) in deeper, finer-grained sediments, Selection is strong (governing {$\sim$}60\% of turnover), being imposed by an unmeasured but spatially structured environmental variable; (iii) in shallower, coarser-grained sediments, Selection is weaker (governing {$\sim$}30\% of turnover), being imposed by vertically and horizontally structured hydrological factors;(iv) low levels of Dispersal can govern nearly 30\% of turnover and be caused primarily by spatial isolation resulting from limited exchange between finer and coarser-grain sediments; and (v) highly permeable sediments are associated with high levels of Dispersal that homogenize community composition and govern over 20\% of turnover. We further show that our framework provides inferences that cannot be achieved using preexisting approaches, and suggest that their broad application will facilitate a unified understanding of microbial communities.},

The prevalence of dispersal in rapidly expanding populations is held to be the best evidence for presaturation dispersal. Because dispersal reduces the growth rate of source populations, it is generally believed that emigration is not balanced by immigration, and that mortality of emigrants occurs as a result of movement into a 'sink' of unfavourable habitat. If such dispersal is age- or sex-biased, the demo graphy of the population is markedly affected, as a consequence of differ ences in mortality in the dispersive sex or age class. Habitat heterogeneity consequently underlies this interpretation of dispersal and its demographic consequences, although the spatial variability of environments is rarely assessed in dispersal studies.},

  abstract = {(1) It has been suggested (e.g. by Hassell, Southwood \& Reader 1987) that spatial density dependence can be an important cause of temporal density dependence and stability, while at the same time making these effects difficult to detect in the field. In particular, these authors claim that spatially density-dependent mortality stabilizes a discrete-time single-species model, and that field populations failing to show temporal density dependence may be stabilized by such spatial density dependence. (2) We show that the single-species model of spatial density dependence due to De Jong (1979), and a variant of it used by Hassell, Southwood \& Reader (1987), are stable because they contain explicit temporal, as well as spatial, density dependence. Because of this, the models are stable even without spatial heterogeneity. (3) To obtain spatial density dependence without temporal density dependence, we derive a model differing from De Jong's only in making the fraction dying in a patch a function of the relative density, i.e. (density in the patch)/(average patch density for that generation), rather than the absolute density. Thus, mortality on a patch with the average density is the same in each generation. (4) Our model shows that spatial heterogeneity and density dependence can induce temporal density dependence and greater stability. When there is no heterogeneity, mortality is constant and our model becomes the null model of geometric growth or decline (or stasis, if fertility and mortality are exactly matched). When heterogeneity is added, our model yields a region of values of fertility and mortality (on a patch of average density) giving stability. (5) However, our model suggests that spatial heterogeneity is more likely to be destabilizing than stabilizing. Spatial density dependence introduces inverse temporal density dependence at low (and often all) densities. For the negative binomial distribution of patch densities and any given level of fertility, the mortality on a patch of average density must lie in a very small range if stability is to be possible, and this range shrinks steadily as clumping is increased. The range is negligible or non-existent for commonly observed values of the clumping parameter.},

Previous work has assumed that stream fish communities will show either persistence about an equilibrium because of strong density-dependent processes or random variation in structure as a result of environmental stochasticity. In a 10-year study of a California stream, fish community structure changed under the influence of storm-induced high discharge events that impacted recruitment. Species' relative abundances were altered as pre-recruitment stream discharges differentially influenced year-class strength among species with contrasting life histories. Simulation of stream fish community assembly under flow-driven recruitment variation indicates that community structure will vary depending on how particular high-flow events affect species' relative abundances and ongoing density-dependent processes, including competition and predation. Results suggest that stream fish communities are likely to show alternate states rather than a single persistent equilibrium. However, community assembly will not be random but will depend on situation-specific interactions between density-independent and density-dependent processes.},

  abstract = {Gulf sturgeon spawn on portions of three sites in the upper Suwannee River, which may appropriately be described as spawning reefs. The same areas are utilized from year to year. Habitat factors important in spawning site determination include gravel/cobble substrate, the presence of eddy fields, a neutral to slightly alkaline pH, and an empirically observed range in calcium ion content (6--18 mg/L Ca++, corresponding to a conductivity range of 40--110{$\mu$}S). Eggs are deposited contagiously within a small area ({$<$} 10,000 m2) with very little scatter, suggesting little if any current drift. They are not found from samplers on immediately adjacent sand substrate. The broadcast spawner model does not seem to fit the Gulf sturgeon. Spawning begins 4--7 days after the March new moon, with water temperature above 17.0 oC, and extends for 9--23 days as discrete events involving individual females. Spawning may continue, if water temperature remains below 21--22oC. The total annual pool of spawning females in the Suwannee population is estimated at 80 individuals. Young of the year utilize open sand habitat away from shoreline and vegetated habitat. They disperse widely, and occur over freshwater reaches from rkm 10--237; no particular affinity with spring water habitat is evident. Larger Gulf sturgeon tend to congregate in deep holes serving as summer-fall holding areas. They fast and lose weight while remaining in freshwater, but more than compensate this loss during winter feeding in marine waters. The major downriver migration to the estuary takes place in October-November. After a period of river mouth staging, subadults and adults migrate into Gulf of Mexico nearshore mesohaline waters. They move further out and into deeper water ({$>$} 3 m) when water temperatures drop in mid-December, but final destinations in mid-winter remain unknown. Age-2 through 6 juveniles remain in the river mouth estuary over winter. In late January through early February YOY migrate downriver for the first time, joining larger juveniles to overwinter and feed. Tag and recapture data yield a Suwannee River population of Gulf sturgeon estimated at 7,650 individuals, with an annual turnover rate of 16\%. Based on stability in cumulative recapture rates from 1991--1998, population size is stable with an effective balance between recruitment and mortality. However, population structure is dynamic, controlled by the juxtaposition, conjunction, and summation of successive strong and weak year classes. Length/age frequency distributions for 1995 and 1998 populations censuses are very different. The 1995 distribution is bimodal with a dominant mode of 9--14 year old subadults/adults, and a sub-dominant of mode of 2--4 year old juveniles. The 1998 distribution is trimodal, but overwhelmingly dominated by 6--9 year old subadults. Erosion by 1998 of the major subadult/adult mode from the 1995 census illustrates that large adults encounter the same high mortality as smaller fish. Ultimate adult size in the population has remained constant at 2.2 cm TL over 13 years, indicating a maximum life expectancy of 25 years for Suwannee River Gulf sturgeon.},

In this paper I develop a general model using dynamic programming to investigate conditions under which fidelity to a previously occupied territory will be advantageous. The results predict that site fidelity should be inversely related to heterogeneity in territory quality and the animal's lifespan and positively related to the cost of changing territories, age and probability of mortality in the habitat. The predictability of reproductive outcome (defined as the probability that next period's outcome will be the same as this period's outcome) also affects site fidelity. In predictable habitats, changing territories may be favoured after a bad previous outcome. In contrast, settlement should be independent of the previous outcome in unpredictable habitats. Individuals should also be site-faithful in unpredictable habitats, as long as the mean territory quality is equal among available territories. I also investigate the success of two potential decision rules (`always stay' and `win-stay: lose-switch') relative to the optimal settlement strategy. The results show that these rules may perform as well as the optimal strategy under certain conditions. The always stay strategy does well in unpredictable habitats, when the mean quality within a territory is equal among territories. In contrast, the win-stay: lose-switch strategy performs best in predictable habitats.},

We addressed this research gap here by first quantifying the historical complexity of landscapes, including natural and agricultural formations, in terms of their composition and configuration in 26 tropical catchment areas surrounding 101 streams over a 30-year period. We identified clear evidence for a memory effect of past events, whereby higher historical landscape complexity, measured as the information entropy of landscape composition, led to higher freshwater biodiversity. Finally, using a causal discovery approach, we showed that species richness was causally related to landscape complexity only when historical values were incorporated. Our results corroborate previous work on the positive effect of landscape complexity on biodiversity, and also confirm the role of historical contingencies in predicting future ecological outcomes.},

  abstract = {Understanding how communities respond to environmental change is frustrated by the fact that both species interactions and movement affect biodiversity in unseen ways. To evaluate the contributions of species interactions on community growth, dynamic models that can capture nonlinear responses to the environment and the redistribution of species across a spatial range are required. We develop a time-series framework that models the effects of environment--species interactions as well as species--species interactions on population growth within a community. Novel aspects of our model include allowing for species redistribution across a spatial region, and addressing the issue of zero inflation. We adopt a hierarchical Bayesian approach, enabling probabilistic uncertainty quantification in the model parameters. To evaluate the impacts of interactions and movement on population growth, we apply our model using data from eBird, a global citizen science database. To do so, we also present a novel method of aggregating the spatially biased eBird data collected at point-level. Using an illustrative region in North Carolina, we model communities of six bird species. The results provide evidence of nonlinear responses to interactions with the environment and other species and demonstrate a pattern of strong intraspecific competition coupled with many weak interspecific species interactions.

Organisms may disperse among patches to fulfill life-history requirements, but biotic and abiotic factors may limit patch or locality occupancy. Thus, the dynamics of immigration and extinction determine, in part, the local structure of assemblages. We sampled fishes and stream habitat at 12 localities for two years (96 samples) to examine the deterministic nature of immigration and extinction processes in stream fish assemblages. Mean immigration rates for assemblages were highest at large stream localities, where the pool of potential immigrants was largest. Mean extinction rates were highest where variability in the flow regime was high, though local refugia appeared to modify the extinction process at one locality. Significant nested subset patterns in species composition occurred over time for 7 of the 12 localities. The strength of the nesting was associated with mean immigration and extinction rates. Higher extinction rates corresponded to stronger nestedness, whereas higher immigration rates were associated with weaker nestedness. Across all species, both immigration and extinction rates were strongly associated with mean abundance. Species with high local abundances had higher immigration rates and lower extinction rates than did species with low local abundances. There were no significant associations between trophic guild or body size and immigration and extinction rate. This work supports the hypothesis that immigration and extinction rates for assemblages are predictable along environmental gradients, and that species are less prone to local extinction and more prone to colonize areas when they maintain high local abundances. The extinction process in local assemblages can be a highly ordered event leading to strong nested subset patterns, but immigration appears to be more stochastic.},

We examined movement patterns of Masu Salmon (Oncorhynchus masou masou), the obligate host fish for the freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera laevis, during the mussel's parasitic period to determine the dispersal potential of glochidia via host fish in the Shubuto River system, Hokkaido, Japan. We conducted a mark--recapture study in a 650-m river section to describe the distance and directionality of host fish movement, and we used fyke net sampling to quantify the number of host fish moving from mainstem rivers to tributaries. Most individuals of Masu Salmon captured in the study were infected with glochidia of M. laevis. The displacement distance of infected fishes ranged from 37.5 m downstream to 512.5 m upstream (mean = 36.5 m upstream from marking location). The dispersal kernel based on a diffusion--advection model represented a leptokurtic distribution with a fat-tailed upstream bias, but most recaptured fish remained near the initial capture location. Movement of fish from mainstem rivers to tributaries was strongly affected by differences in water temperature among tributaries. Most individuals moved to cooler tributaries, but tributaries did not support populations of M. laevis. These results suggest that glochidial dispersal via host fish is important for local recruitment and upstream dispersal, but dispersal to tributaries may be a source of mortality for M. laevis.},

  abstract = {Capture--recapture methods have been a cornerstone of field-based dispersal ecology. However, obtaining unbiased estimates of dispersal parameters from capture--recapture data is challenging because it is impossible to survey all possible range of dispersal in the field. There are several approaches to address this critical issue of capture--recapture methods. Still, a lack of formal comparisons among these modeling approaches has confused about which is the best practice given the available dataset. Here, I compared the performance of three dispersal models using test datasets simulated under various sampling designs. In the first approach, a probability distribution (a dispersal kernel) was simply fitted to the capture--recapture data (the ``simple dispersal model''). In the second approach, a truncated probability distribution was used to account for the finite range of observations (the ``truncated dispersal model''). Finally, the dispersal and observation processes were coupled to consider the spatial organization of sampling designs (the ``dispersal--observation model''). The simulation study provided three important insights. First, the dispersal--observation model provided reliable estimates of dispersal parameters, even under sampling designs with a few recaptures. Second, the truncated dispersal model was also effective, but only when the number of recaptures was large. Finally, the use of the simple dispersal model caused a substantial underestimation of dispersal parameters regardless of sampling designs; this modeling approach should be avoided where possible. The results of this simulation study should help choose a suitable modeling approach.},

  abstract = {Although the prevailing paradigms in spatial ecology have treated dispersal as a stochastic process, there is an increasing awareness that spatial processes are non-random such that individual characteristics and ecological contexts influence dispersal. Natural disturbance, such as river flooding, is known to stimulate dispersal behaviour, but its interactive effects with individual-level characteristics (e.g. body size) of potential dispersers remain elusive. It is critical to fill this knowledge gap because anthropogenic impacts (including climate change) alter both disturbance regimes and population structures. Here, we examined how extreme high flows and individual body size combined to influence dispersal of three fishes (creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, bluehead chub Nocomis leptocephalus, and striped jumprock Moxostoma rupicartes) in two streams (740 and 520 m long) in South Carolina, U.S.A. We focused on extreme high flows as a natural disturbance, whereas body size was used as an individual-level characteristic of dispersers. A total of 5,604 individuals were uniquely marked in the two streams over a {$>$}2-year study period, during which sampling occurred every 2 months. The intensive capture--recapture study revealed differential effects of disturbance and body size among sympatric stream fishes. Extreme high flows increased dispersal of striped jumprock and creek chub, whereas body size influenced dispersal of striped jumprock with larger individuals traveling longer distances. Bluehead chub showed a complex dispersal response. That is, size-dependence in dispersal emerged only during high-flow periods. The results of this study build upon previous efforts by providing field-based evidence of how disturbance and individual characteristics (body size) combine to drive non-random dispersal and how it varies among sympatric species. This finding is important because metapopulations that are maintained by different non-random dispersal (i.e. externally or internally driven) may show varied sensitivities to human-induced environmental changes.},

However, current theories treat post-infection dispersal propensities as a fixed trait, and the plastic nature of host's responses to parasite infection has long been underappreciated. Here, we present a mark--recapture experiment in a single host--parasite system (larval parasites of the freshwater mussel Margaritifera laevis and its salmonid fish host Oncorhynchus masou masou) and provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence that parasite infection induces size-dependent host dispersal in the field. In response to parasite infection, large fish become more dispersive, whereas small fish tend to stay at the home patch. The observed plasticity in dispersal is interpretable from the viewpoint of host fitness: expected benefits (release from further infection) may exceed dispersal-associated costs for individuals with high dispersal ability (i.e. large fish) but are marginal for individuals with limited dispersal ability (i.e. small fish). Indeed, our growth analysis revealed that only small fish hosts incurred dispersal costs (reduced growth). Strikingly, our simulation study revealed that this plastic dispersal response of infected hosts substantially enhanced parasite persistence and occupancy in a spatially structured system. These results suggest that dispersal plasticity in host species is critical for understanding how parasites emerge, spatially spread, and persist in nature. Our findings provide a novel starting point for building a reliable, predictive model for parasite/disease management.},

Fish communities often consist of discrete and nonrandom species assemblages. Stream fish communities are all structured none randomly in space. In a meta-community framework, local fish communities may be structured by both spatial and environmental factors. Most fish in small, stable streams are most probably habitat specialists that have evolved various morphological and behavioral adaptations to exploit specific habitat types. Over large geographical and habitat scales, environmental filtering and anthropogenic effects are generally the most important determinants of assemblage variability. Streams are important habitats, providing shelter and feeding opportunities for a wide range of organisms like fish, insects, plants, mollusks, birds and mammals. Fish community structure depends on biotic interactions and abiotic variables. Predation is a major determinant of ecological patterns in fresh water fish communities. Resource partitioning among fishes suggest that competition may play an important role in the local organization of communities. Most studies are based on field observations, and many suggest that niche segregation rather than competitive exclusion is the predominant outcome resulting from competitive interactions. Finally, we saw that, fish community composition was negatively affected by human impact, Climate change, introduction of exotic spices and tourism or sports on streams.},

Dispersal plasticity is often considered through its dependence on abiotic conditions or conspecific density and, to a lesser extent, with reference to the effects of interactions with heterospecifics, potentially leading to misinterpretation of dispersal drivers. Here, we first review the evidence for the effects of and the potential interplays between abiotic factors, biotic interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics and phenotype on dispersal decisions. We then present an experimental test of these potential interplays, investigating the effects of density and interactions with conspecifics and heterospecifics on temperature-dependent dispersal in microcosms of Tetrahymena ciliates. We found significant differences in dispersal rates depending on the temperature, density and presence of another strain or species. However, the presence and density of conspecifics and heterospecifics had no effects on the thermal-dependency of dispersal. We discuss the causes and consequences of the (lack of) interplay between the different environmental dimensions and the phenotype for metacommunity assembly and dynamics.

However, identifying the temporal window over which a consumer's isotopic signature reflects its diet requires an understanding of elemental incorporation, a process that varies from days to years across species and tissue types. Though theory predicts body size and temperature are likely to control incorporation rates, this has not been tested empirically across a morphologically and phylogenetically diverse range of taxa. Readily available estimates of this relationship would, however, aid in the design of stable isotope food web investigations and improve the interpretation of isotopic data collected from natural systems. Using literature-derived turnover estimates from animal species ranging in size from 1 mg to 2000 kg, we develop a predictive tool for stable isotope ecologists, allowing for estimation of incorporation rates in the structural tissues of entirely novel taxa. In keeping with metabolic scaling theory, we show that isotopic turnover rates of carbon and nitrogen in whole organisms and muscle tissue scale allometrically with body mass raised approximately to the power -0{$\cdot$}19, an effect modulated by body temperature. This relationship did not, however, apply to incorporation rates in splanchnic tissues, which were instead dependent on the thermoregulation tactic employed by an organism, being considerably faster in endotherms than ectotherms. We believe the predictive turnover equations we provide can improve the design of experiments and interpretation of results obtained in future stable isotopic food web studies.},

To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density-independent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density-dependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.},

Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a high global priority.},

  abstract = {All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two---way or three---way interspecific trade---offs among competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade---offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

  abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity--productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better ``coverage'' of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity--invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

  abstract = {Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide ``slices'' of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.},

  abstract = {One of the central questions of ecology is why there are so many different kinds of plants and animals. Here David Tilman presents a theory of how organisms compete for resources and the way their competition promotes diversity. Developing Hutchinson's suggestion that the main cause of diversity is the feeding relations of species, this book builds a mechanistic, resource-based explanation of the structure and functioning of ecological communities. In a detailed analysis of the Park Grass Experiments at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in England, the author demonstrates that the dramatic results of these 120 years of experimentation are consistent with his theory, as are observations in many other natural communities. The consumer-resource approach of this book is applicable to both animal and plant communities, but the majority of Professor Tilman's discussion concentrates on the structure of plant communities. All theoretical arguments are developed graphically, and formal mathematics is kept to a minimum. The final chapters of the book provide some testable speculations about resources and animal communities and explore such problems as the evolution of "super species," the differences between plant and animal community diversity patterns, and the cause of plant succession.},

To evaluate the role of plant--plant interactions in shaping these communities we quantified species co-occurrence and interaction in seven environmentally distinct communities. These included four different semiarid habitats in southeast Spain, one alpine system in the Sierra Nevada range (Spain), and two sites in Venezuela, a secondary savanna near Caracas (Altos de Pipe), and a sclerophyllous shrubland in the Gran Sabana plateau. We expected that facilitation would be stronger at sites with more spatial associations. The four semiarid sites in Spain and the shrubland in Gran Sabana showed a high degree of positive species associations. Of the other two communities, one showed both positive and negative associations while negative ones predominated in Altos de Pipe. The direct experimental measure of neighbors' effect showed that positive interactions among species prevailed in communities where positive species associations dominated. The appearance of benefactor species in patches increased species richness compared with the surrounding inter-shrub spaces. Our results provide a link between spatial patterns and species interactions, where aggregation points to positive interactions and segregation to competitive or interference effects. Facilitation appears as a relevant process shaping communities under environmental constraints.},

Niche theory explains co-occurrence via functional differences among taxa that reduce competition and promote resource partitioning. Alternatively, the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography suggests that co-occurrence can be attributed to stochastic processes, and thus, presupposes that ecologically similar species that occur in sympatry are functionally analogous. We test these hypotheses using the most diverse crustacean-sea anemone symbiosis from coral reefs in the Tropical Western Atlantic. {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N stable isotope analyses of six crustacean symbionts that co-occur around the host anemone Bartholomea annulata exhibit highly differentiated isotopic niche space spanning several trophic levels. As multiple crustacean species within the symbiosis have been documented as cleaners that remove parasites from reef fishes, we extended our investigation into the broader cleaner community. Our stable isotope analyses of cleaners shows that Pederson's cleaner shrimp Ancylomenes pedersoni exhibits the highest {$\delta$}15N isotopic values- significantly higher than all other putative cleaner species and consistent with expectations of a dedicated cleaning lifestyle. However, for other species previously described or observed to clean reef fishes, including Periclimenes yucatanicus, Stenopus hispidus and Stenorhynchus seticornis, {$\delta$}15N isotopic values were substantially lower, raising questions about the degree to which these species rely on cleaning interactions to meet their nutritional requirements. Taken together, our data are consistent with the expectations of niche theory: co-occurring symbiotic crustaceans have highly partitioned niche space with low levels of functional redundancy.},

Fish remained in restricted home ranges for most of the year but tended to disperse in spring when all of the radio-tagged fish left their home pool; 75\% returned during the same season. Equal numbers of fish moved upstream and downstream. However, the median distance moved upstream was greater. Intrapool movement of smallmouth bass peaked soon after sunrise and again after sunset in all seasons. Average intrapool movement was 120 m/d when water temperatures were lowest (4{$^\circ$}C) and 980 m/d when temperatures were highest (27.5{$^\circ$}C). In the warmer seasons, fish preferred logjams and root wads by day and increased their use of boulders at night. In cooler seasons, fish used boulders almost exclusively. Regardless of season, open water without cover was used most during the period just after sunrise but was never used in proportion to its availability. Boulders were the most preferred substrate, and gravel was the least preferred. Small mouth bass used intermediate depths the most and showed no daily or seasonal changes in depth preferences. Fish preferred velocities less than 0.2 m/s at all times of day and in all seasons. Movements in floods did not differ from those observed during normal discharges; however, single logs were selected in significantly greater proportion than logjams.},

We conducted a systematic literature search of research directed towards understanding factors that influence biodiversity in lotic habitats, published in 31 major ecological and freshwater science journals from 1981 to 2014. Our goal was to characterize emergent themes in research successes and identify important areas in need of study. We show an overwhelming taxonomic bias favoring studies of macroinvertebrates and fish, and a paucity in studies of other important groups such as bacteria and fungi. While most studies assessed habitat variables that affect diversity at a local scale, there has been a recent push to investigate regional drivers of beta and gamma diversity. Several factors were consistently found to be important drivers of diversity including local habitat type, hydrologic variables, disturbance, and stream morphometry. Others such as nutrients and chemical variables showed mixed support. Species interactions, dispersal, and evolutionary processes were rarely considered but show promise as fruitful areas for future study. We suggest that researchers should give increased attention to diversity drivers at different scales as well as take advantage of new molecular techniques to address questions regarding organismal diversity in streams.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE Dorsal white muscle is the standard tissue analysed in fish trophic studies using stable isotope analyses. However, sampling white muscle often implies the sacrifice of fish. Thus, we examined whether the non-lethal sampling of fin tissue can substitute muscle sampling in food web studies. METHODS Analysing muscle and fin {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C values of 466 European freshwater fish (14 species) with an elemental analyser coupled with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, we compared the isotope values of the two tissues. Correlations between fin and muscle isotope ratios were examined for all fish together and specifically for 12 species. We further proposed four methods of assessing muscle from fin isotope ratios and estimated the errors made using these muscle surrogates. RESULTS Despite significant differences between isotope values of the two tissues, fin and muscle isotopic signals are strongly correlated. Muscle values, estimated with raw fin isotope ratios (1st method), induce an error of ca. 1? for both isotopes. In comparison, specific (2nd method) or general (3rd method) correlations provide meaningful corrections of fin isotope ratios (errors {$<$}0.6?). On the other hand, relationships, established for Australian tropical fish, only give poor muscle estimates (errors {$>$}0.8?). CONCLUSIONS There is little chance that a global model can be created. However, the 2nd and 3rd methods of estimating muscle values from fin isotope ratios should provide an acceptable level of error for the studies of European freshwater food web. We thus recommend that future studies use fin tissue as a non-lethal surrogate for muscle. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper I develop a model of movement with attraction or repulsion between conspecifics. To facilitate its use in empirical studies, the model is based on experimentally measurable features of individual behaviour. (2) Attraction among individuals leads to movement which is biased towards areas of high population density. However, aggregations can arise only if mutual attraction is strong enough to dominate the dispersive effect due to random motion. I use the model to define the conditions for formation of an aggregated spatial pattern in homogeneous space. The model is applied to the aggregative movement in Aphis varians. (3) To investigate how spatial inhomogeneity can interact with density-dependent movement I consider a population of animals foraging for a patchy resource, e.g. insect herbivores moving among patches of their host-plants. The results of the model indicate that gregarious behaviour of herbivores strongly amplifies the effects of patch size on herbivore density. Field studies of the Mexican bean beetle-garden bean system provide experimental support for this theoretical prediction. (4) The modelling framework developed in this paper provides a tool for studying effects of aggregation on predator-prey and competitive interactions, since demographic and population interaction terms can be readily added to the model.},

Aggressive interactions were observed between most pairs of SSG's, an almost linear dominance order being apparent throughout the three-month study period. Ayu were relatively subordinate in June, but became the second most dominant in July and the most dominant in August, as a consequence of a reversal in dominance order with salmon. In contrast, smaller-sized dace, which continually suffered from intra- and interspecific aggression, occupied the most subordinate ranks throughout the study period. Intensive aggression was observed among various SSG's, exhibiting same microhabitat propensity throughout the three months. The direction and frequency of aggressive interactions varied month by month due to a reversal in dominance order between ayu and masu salmon, and/or changes in density, body size and resource use of the component members. Opponent selectivity was higher within SSG's, where resource use was assumed to be highly overlapping, rather than among SSG's throughout the study period. Correlation analysis indicated that opponent selectivity in aggressive interactions among SSG's was positively correlated with similarity in microhabitat selectivity in June, but not in other months or with that in foraging habits, suggesting that intensive aggressive behaviour reflected overlapping habitat use among assemblage members during a certain period.},

At the family level, suckers, darters, and especially minnows were notable for occupying several habitat-use guilds, because of species differences in habitat preferences. Such formulation of guilds can simplify habitat-impact analyses in biodiverse, warmwater streams, via focus on habitat needs of guilds rather than on individual species.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Studies like mark-release-recapture work, show patterns of movement, but do not provide insight into the behavioural mechanisms. We review and comment recent results on animal dispersal behaviour. Dispersal through a landscape can be realised in two different ways: as a by-product of routine movements associated with resource exploitation (like foraging or mate-searching) with high levels of returning, or, as special, fast and directed movements designed for displacement. We illustrate and discuss both classes of movements as behaviourally different types. These types of movement imply different assumptions and consequences. We point at potential biases of current studies (like mark-release-recapture studies) towards routine, explorative movements. A more accurate knowledge of the dispersal behaviour is important to model dispersal with more biological realism, but also to better understand evolutionary consequences (e.g. uncoupled evolution of routine and special movements) and conservation (e.g. relative importance of corridors). The contribution of routine movements to dispersal is expected to decline with habitat fragmentation. A species' mobility is not a static trait, but a multiple trait, the components of which may evolve rapidly. The possibility of uncoupled selection on routine movements and real dispersal movements remains to be evaluated. Yet, we are only at the beginning of understanding the behavioural ecology of dispersal movements. A more careful treatment of behavioural components of mobility within observational and experimental studies of animal dispersal is needed. Zusammenfassung Die Ausbreitung ist ein Schl{\"u}sselprozess der {\"O}kologie sowie der Evolutions- und Naturschutzbiologie. Untersuchungen wie Fang-Wiederfang-Arbeiten zeigen Muster der Bewegung, bieten jedoch keine Einsicht in die Verhaltensmechanismen. Wir geben einen {\"U}berblick und kommentieren neuere Ergebnisse zum Ausbreitungsverhalten der Tiere. Die Ausbreitung {\"u}ber eine Landschaft kann in zwei unterschiedlichen Weisen realisiert werden: als ein Nebenprodukt von Routinebewegungen mit einem hohen R{\"u}ckkehranteil, die mit der Ressourcennutzung assoziiert sind (wie Nahrungsaufnahme und Partnersuche), oder als spezialisierte, schnelle und gerichtete Bewegung zur Ortsver{\"a}nderung. Wir illustrieren und diskutieren beide Klassen der Bewegung als unterschiedliche Verhaltenstypen. Diese Typen der Bewegung implizieren unterschiedliche Annahmen und Konsequenzen. Wir weisen auf die potenzielle Ausrichtung aktueller Untersuchungen (wie Fang-Wiederfang-Untersuchungen) auf explorative Routinebewegungen hin. Ein genaueres Wissen um das Ausbreitungsverhalten ist wichtig, um die Ausbreitung mit gr{\"o}{\ss}erem biologischen Realismus zu modellieren, aber auch, um evolution{\"a}re Konsequenzen (nicht gekoppelte Evolution von Routine- und speziellen Bewegungen) und den Schutz (z. B. die relative Bedeutung von Korridoren) besser zu verstehen. Es wird erwartet, dass der Beitrag der Routinebewegungen zur Ausbreitung mit der Habitatfragmentierung abnehmen wird. Die Mobilit{\"a}t einer Art ist keine statische, sondern eine multiple Eigenschaft, deren Komponenten sehr schnell evolvieren k{\"o}nnten. Die M{\"o}glichkeit der nicht gekoppelten Selektion von Routinebewegung und echten Ausbreitungsbewegungen bleibt weiterhin zu erforschen. Noch sind wir am Beginn eines Verst{\"a}ndnisses der Verhaltens{\"o}kologie von Ausbreitungsbewegungen. Eine sorgf{\"a}ltigere Behandlung der Verhaltenskomponenten der Mobilit{\"a}t bei Beobachtungen und experimentellen Untersuchungen der Ausbreitung von Tieren ist notwendig.},

To estimate the predation effect of cormorants on perch populations, we Passive Integrated Tags tagged 1977 perch and 9.9\% of tags were found. The median instantaneous cormorant-induced mortality during the breeding time, with consumption by non-breeding individuals, was estimated at 0.23 and at 0.35 during the whole residing period. We estimated with a yeild-per-recruit model that the longterm maximum loss of perch yield of tagged sub-population would be at 80\% probability interval 32--67\%, and when extended to the entire 55H1, 10--33\%, respectively. The cormorants' share of the {$>$}2-year-old perch biomass and production would be 8\%, while that of other natural mortality would be 63\% and that of fishing 29\% in 55H1. The yield-per-recruit-results should be interpreted as an estimate of maximum cormorant effect because the dependence of predation rate on prey density was not accounted for, and density-dependence of growth, mortality, and reproduction of perch could partly compensate the loss. The results indicate that high density of cormorants can reduce the perch stocks and catches locally.},

Therefore, we assessed the impact of biotic variables on fish habitat preferences in four selected stretches of the upper Cabriel River (E Spain). The occurrence of Squalius pyrenaicus and Luciobarbus guiraonis was related to environmental variables describing biotic interactions (inferred by relationships among fish abundances) and channel hydro-morphological characteristics. Random Forests (RF) models were trained and then validated using independent datasets. To build RF models, the conditional variable importance was used together with the model improvement ratio technique. The procedure showed effectiveness in identifying a parsimonious set of not correlated variables, which minimize noise and improve model performance in both training and validation phases. Water depth, channel width, fine substrate and water-surface gradient were selected as most important habitat variables for both fish. Results showed clear habitat overlapping between fish species and suggest that competition is not a strong factor in the study area.},

Spatial arrangement of trees significantly affected immigration, with higher immigration and higher turnover rates where there were more potentially interacting populations. 4. Densities were higher and persistence was greater where immigration rates were higher. 5. Immigration slowed the tendency for natural and augmented density populations to converge to similar densities. 6. The patterns observed were consistent with the hypothesis that T. pyri can sometimes drive P. ulmi populations to extinction on individual small apple trees. 7. Increasing the number of interacting populations and thus immigration rates slowed down the tendency to extinction, but it is not clear whether at the spatial scale of an orchard the ultimate outcome would still be extinction of P. ulmi or if persistence is the rule.},

Projected effects of climate change and land alterations suggest headwater streams may become more intermittent and less predictable, consequently altering biological processes (i.e. dispersal or movement) that govern population dynamics. Few studies have provided insight into movement dynamics of nongame fishes in small headwater streams that commonly experience intermittent conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate movement of a fish species adapted to intermittent stream conditions. Our objectives were to (i) describe the general movement patterns of creek chub, Semotilus atromaculatus, in an intermittent stream and (ii) investigate which ecological factors may influence movement in patchy environments. Creek chub displayed some of the longest distances moved compared to many other stream fishes in perennial streams (179--1069 m seasonal averages; 4678 m maximum distance). Directional movement was significant only in May with more individuals moving upstream. The probability of creek chub movement was inversely related to habitat complexity and pool area. Creek chub adapted to intermittent stream conditions not only exhibited increases in the frequency and distance of movement compared to other nongame fishes, but also exhibited movements in relation to local habitat metrics. These results demonstrate some of the potential adaptations that are likely to promote the survival and persistence of populations in highly dynamic environments such as intermittent streams.},

Using mark--recapture, we examined movement patterns of southern redbelly dace, Chrosomus erythrogaster, in an intermittent Ozark stream having both permanently connected and temporally isolated sections. Juvenile (60--88\%) and adult (55--83\%) residency rates were not significantly different for any mark--recapture sample, and movement was primarily within a section for both groups. Ontogenetic differences were detected for kurtosis, distance moved and population spread, with adults exhibiting greater variability in movement, moving more often and further. When considering only adults, there was a significantly higher number of individuals that exhibited intermovement from isolated sections compared with connected sections. In addition, a higher proportion of adults exhibiting intermovement moved to connected stream sections in May and July compared to January and March. Dace exhibited upstream bias in July, with 76\% of emigrates moving to an upstream connected section. Although there were no statistically significant associations between the proportion of intermovers from connected and isolated sections and measured water quality and habitat variables, noteworthy trends were observed, and these trends were always stronger for connected sections. Understanding the factors that influence population dynamics in headwater streams is important for the survival and persistence of stream fish populations, especially considering the anticipated expansion of intermittent headwater streams as a result of future climatic changes.},

This book examines how these modeling methods work, why they sometimes fail, and how they might be improved by incorporating larger ecological interactions. Fisheries Ecology and Management provides a broad introduction to the concepts and quantitative models needed to successfully manage fisheries.Walters and Martell develop models that account for key ecological dynamics such as trophic interactions, food webs, multi-species dynamics, risk-avoidance behavior, habitat selection and density-dependence. They treat fisheries policy development as a two-stage process, first identifying strategies for varying harvest in relation to changes in abundance, then finding ways to implement such strategies in terms of monitoring and regulatory procedures. This book provides a general framework for developing assessment models in terms of state-observation dynamics hypotheses, and points out that most fisheries assessment failures have been due to inappropriate observation model hypotheses rather than faulty models for ecological dynamics.Intended as a text in upper division and graduate classes on fisheries assessment and management, this useful guide will also be widely read by ecologists and fisheries scientists.},

  abstract = {Intraspecific food competition exerts powerful selective forces on all animals; successful foragers thrive relative to weaker conspecifics. Understanding competition is therefore fundamental both to ecological insight and to conservation efforts. Fish are adaptable and tractable experimental organisms, offering excellent model systems for studies on competition, and they lend themselves to two approaches: (i) studies of short-term competition, which quantify the components of behavioural interactions; (ii) studies of long-term interactions, in which the indeterminate nature of fish growth makes it possible to measure rates directly and correlate them with competitive success. The nature and the intensity of competition vary according to resource characteristics and distributions in time and space, the ecological context, and the relative competitive abilities of the foragers. Second-order effects, such as winner and loser consequences, add to the complexity and frustrated early attempts to develop realistic models of intraspecific competition. Recently, however, considerable advances have been made in both laboratory and field studies on fishes adding to our understanding of these interacting effects. At the same time, the application of individual-based modelling offers the prospect of progress towards greater realism and accuracy in predicting competitive outcomes. This review draws together a wide and disparate literature on intraspecific competition in fishes to facilitate the work of both empiricists and theoreticians towards these important goals. In the short term, competing individuals may adopt different behavioural strategies and feeding patterns or establish dominance hierarchies and feeding territories. In the longer term, competition can drive character displacement and the formation of species pairs and fish provide some of the most compelling examples of these processes in evolutionary biology. The challenge for the future is to further develop our understanding of the relationship between the competitive environment and the responses of fishes, particularly with closer co-operation between empiricists and theoreticians, and to apply this knowledge to aquaculture and to better management of exploited fish stocks.},

  abstract = {As management tools, freshwater reserves are under-represented in protected area networks for fisheries conservation and enhancement. This is surprising considering that freshwater ecosystems, and the biodiversity they support, are among the most threatened worldwide. We compared freshwater reserve types established to prevent overexploitation of migratory galaxiids (mostly {\=i}nanga Galaxias maculatus) from fishing and evaluated their performance as reproductive reservoirs. We studied 10 streams classified into three a priori types: (a) closed, (b) partially closed and (c) open streams. Closed streams had greater abundances, biomasses and egg production of G. maculatus despite having a greater proportion of smaller fish compared to partially closed and open streams. Community-level analyses indicated differences in fish assemblages between closure types. Large, native, predatory fish (longfin eel Anguilla dieffenbachii, shortfin eel Anguilla australis and giant k{\=o}kopu Galaxias argenteus) were more common in closed streams. Overall, there were notable reserve effects related to closed streams. There was slight evidence that partially closed streams conferred some fisheries benefits compared to streams open to fishing. While the limited number of reserve streams warrants some caution in conclusions, partial closures may still be worthwhile as a management tool where complete closure to fishing is not feasible. Closures can be effective in increasing fish numbers, albeit at a cost of smaller sized individuals, most likely because of density-dependent processes relating to food and habitat. Despite clear benefits in total egg production of populations in closed streams, it remains unclear how these benefits may translate across the full life history of the annual G. maculatus. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that freshwater reserves have many of the `reserve effects' observed in more common marine reserves, but there are also important differences. Stream closure should be considered as one potential management tool that is unlikely to be effective unless stream habitats are returned to more pristine states. Our effort to evaluate the explicit effects of different reserve types across different spatial scales is the first we know of for migratory freshwater fishes, providing useful insights for adjusting the current reserve network and establishing new reserves.},

The fairy basslet Gramma loreto (Grammatidae) lives in dominance hierarchies that occupy the undersides of open reef ledges in the Caribbean region. Each hierarchy is maintained by aggression between size classes such that larger fish occupy prime plankton-feeding positions closer to the outer edge of the ledge. We conducted a removal experiment in the central Bahamas to determine the role of larger fish in maintaining the hierarchy and the resultant consequences to smaller fish. When larger fish were removed, smaller individuals quickly occupied these prime feeding positions and were the recipients of less aggression compared to controls. As a result, the average feeding rates of smaller fish were more than 60\% higher in aggregations in which larger fish had been removed. Differences in feeding rates were the result of 2 types of competitive effects: between-position and within-position. The between-position effect was the result of differential feeding rates associated with different feeding positions within an aggregation. The within-position effect was due to interactions within a given feeding position. Although both effects strongly influenced basslet feeding rate, the magnitude of the within-position effect was roughly 3 times that of the between-position effect. Together, these 2 components of competition may affect demographic rates and ultimately contribute to local population regulation.},

When confirmed together in the vegetation the green sunfish exhibited higher survivorship, growth rates, and amount of food in the stomachs that the bluegill. The bluegill fed on smaller items and consumed benthic prey than did the green sunfish. The presence of the congener did not alter the food habits of either species or the growth rates of the green sunfish in relation to species stocked alone. Presence of the congener did affect the growth rates of the bluegill. Overlap in the diet was 70\% when these species were confined to the vegetation as compared to 44\% in an earlier study where habitat separation was permitted. The green sunfish is more of a sit-and-wait predator and is able to utilize a wider food size spectrum than the bluegill. This results in a strong asymmetry in the competition function favoring the green sunfish in the vegetation. However, in the open water column the distribution of food sizes is truncated and this provides a competitive refuge for the bluegill which handles small foods more efficiently. The bluegill appears to be more flexible in its habitat use while the green sunfish is more aggressive and limited in the habitats utilized. Comparisons with studies of habitat shifts in salmonids suggest that the competitive mechanisms outlined are of general relevance in fish communities. Considerations of the relation between habitat structure, the correlated distribution of food sizes, and species morphology provides a framework for specifying the occurence of habitat shifts and which species of the interactive set will shift.},

  abstract = {Movement has been studied extensively in stream salmonids, and most data suggest that population-level behaviour is best described by a leptokurtic distribution. This distribution emphasises the large proportion of sedentary individuals in a population, which can implicitly lead to assumptions of low population connectivity and overlook the ecological significance of rare individuals with more mobile phenotypes. We report findings of a multi-season radio telemetry study conducted on four adjacent populations of wild brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) connected by Loyalsock Creek in north-central Pennsylvania. We used these data to investigate temporal and spatial patterns in movement and fitness trade-offs associated with behavioural phenotype. Similar to previous studies, we found that 59 of the 120 radio-tagged individuals (49\%) were sedentary and moved less than 200 m. Only 18\% of individuals dispersed more than 1 km, but the maximum distance moved exceeded 13 km. We also found that mobile individuals had significantly higher summer and autumn survival than did sedentary fish, which could indicate that there are fitness benefits associated with vagility. Most long-distance movements were the result of fish migrating from small tributaries into a larger mainstem river in the days after spawning. Therefore, even though mobility was only expressed for a short duration and by relatively few individuals in the population, the behaviour appears to maintain metapopulation connectivity throughout the catchment. Our study highlights the ecological significance of rare phenotypes for population demography across large spatial scales and the need to understand movement across multiple temporal and spatial scales to ensure adequate conservation of critical forms of cryptic life history diversity.},

Satellite monitoring is revealing how cyclic and quasi-cyclic climatic patterns, like the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, are driving and synchronising these weather-driven changes in the supplies of food. Changes in the amount of food available operate to limit the abundance of populations largely through their influence on the survival of the very young: the Achilles heel of all populations. Any individual organism struggles to use whatever resources it can get from a mostly inhospitable environment to maximise the proliferation of its genes. Each level of a food chain is thus dependent upon, and pressing hard against the limits set by the one below. The resulting intra- and inter-specific interactions produce a multitude of complex outcomes, that significantly influence the dynamics of populations, but do not determine their ultimate size. There is no density-dependent regulation of abundance. Intra-specific competition does not determine the size of populations, it only decides which few individuals gain access to the limited food. Nor do predators regulate their prey. They, too, are limited by their food, and the abundance and quality of food is dictated by the weather.},

  abstract = {The search for simple principles that underlie the spatial structure and dynamics of plant communities is a long-standing challenge in ecology1--6. In particular, the relationship between species coexistence and the spatial distribution of plants is challenging to resolve in species-rich communities7--9. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of 720 tree species in 21 large forest plots and their consequences for species coexistence. We show that species with low abundance tend to be more spatially aggregated than more abundant species. Moreover, there is a latitudinal gradient in the strength of this negative aggregation--abundance relationship that increases from tropical to temperate forests. We suggest, in line with recent work10, that latitudinal gradients in animal seed dispersal11 and mycorrhizal associations12--14 may jointly generate this pattern. By integrating the observed spatial patterns into population models8, we derive the conditions under which species can invade from low abundance in terms of spatial patterns, demography, niche overlap and immigration. Evaluation of the spatial-invasion condition for the 720 tree species analysed suggests that temperate and tropical forests both meet the invasion criterion to a similar extent but through contrasting strategies conditioned by their spatial patterns. Our approach opens up new avenues for the integration of observed spatial patterns into ecological theory and underscores the need to understand the interaction among spatial patterns at the neighbourhood scale and multiple ecological processes in greater detail.},

Rapidly advancing geographical information systems (GIS) technologies are forcing a careful evaluation of the roles and biases of landscape and traditional site-based perspectives on assessments of aquatic communities. Viewing the world at very different scales can lead to seeming contradictions about the nature of specific ecological systems. In the case of Michigan trout streams, landscape analyses suggest a predictable community shaped by large-scale patterns in hydrology and geology. Most site-based studies, however, suggest these communities are highly variable in structure over time, and are strongly shaped by site-specific physical and biological dynamics. As the real world is comprised of processes operating both at local and landscape scales, an analytical framework for integrating these paradigms is desirable. 2. Decomposition of variances by factorial ANOVA into time, space and time--space interaction terms can provide a conceptual and analytical model for integrating processes operating at landscape and local scales. Using this approach, long-term data sets were examined for three insects and two fishes common in Michigan trout streams. Each taxon had a unique variance structure, and the observed variance structure was highly dependent upon sample size. 3. Both spatially extensive designs with little sampling over time (typical of many GIS studies) and temporally extensive designs with little or no spatial sampling (typical of population and community studies), are biased in terms of their view of the relative importance of local and landscape factors. The necessary, but in many cases costly, solution is to develop and analyse data sets that are both spatially and temporally extensive.},

Here, we examine the utility of fish dorsal fin membrane as an alternative to muscle for analyzing {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N ratios in two reef fish species (blue cod Parapercis colias and spotty Notolabrus celidotus) that have differing feeding modes. Both species exhibited evidence of size-based feeding from fin {$\delta$}15N values, but not from muscle. Blue cod fin {$\delta$}15N increased steadily throughout the sampled size range (213--412~mm fork length), whereas spotty exhibited a distinct ontogenetic diet shift at approximately 120--140~mm fork length after which size-based feeding did not occur. Fin membrane was higher than muscle in {$\delta$}13C in both species and in {$\delta$}15N for blue cod, but fin {$\delta$}15N was lower than muscle in spotty. The {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N fin--muscle offsets were constant in spotty regardless of size, while in blue cod, {$\delta$}13C was constant with fish size, but {$\delta$}15N offsets increased with increasing fish size. Non-lethal sampling utilizing fin tissue can be employed to estimate stable isotope values of muscle in fishes, but it is necessary to assess relationships among tissues and the effects of fish size on isotope values a priori for each species studied. Our data indicated that fin membrane may be a more sensitive tissue than muscle for detecting size-based feeding in some fish species using stable isotopes. A critical literature review revealed inconsistencies in tissue types tested, little understanding of tissue-specific trophic shift or turnover rates, and pseudo-replicated analyses leading to erroneous postulating of 1:1 relationships between tissues.},

Patches are physically identical and differ only in the initial proportion of species that colonize the patches.

Complex interactions can have at least two important effects on metacommunity dynamics. First the number of species coexisting in the metacommunity can greatly exceed the number of species coexisting in any single patch, despite the fact that the patches are physically identical, the species do not differ in colonization ability, and stochastic effects are absent after the colonization stage. Second, complex interactions provide a new source of variation upon which natural selection can operate at the patch level, providing a mechanism for the evolution of functionally organized communities.},

All nine species exhibited peak reproduction during the early wet season and a similar sequence of size-dependent shifts from a diet composed primarily of microcrustacea, to aquatic insects, and finally fishes. Three piranha species specialized on fish fins, particularly at subadult size classes (SL 30--80 mm). Gradual dessication of the floodplain during the transition season was associated with fish growth, increased fish density, and decreased aquatic primary productivity and availability of invertebrate prey. Based on 118 resource categories, average pairwise diet overlap was low during all three seasons: wet, transition, and dry. Of 72 species pairings, only one pair of fin-nipping piranhas exhibited high overlap simultaneously on three niche dimensions: food type, food size, and habitat. Adults of two species, a gymnotid knifefish and pimelodid catfish, were largely nocturnal. Patterns of habitat utilization indicate that piranhas may restrict diurnal use of the open-water region by other piscivores. Collective diet overlap of individual piscivore species with the other eight feeding guild members and collective overlaps with the entire fish community each revealed two basic seasonal trends. Four species that showed an early switch to piscivory also showed a high degree of diet separation with both the guild and community at large on a year-round basis. The five remaining species showed lowest collective diet overlaps during the transition season when availability of invertebrates was reduced and fish densities were maximal. Whereas predation may play a role in habitat separation, diffuse competition for food resources during the approximately four-month transition season probably is the principal factor yielding patterns of diet specialization.},

However, more common day-to-day behaviors, such as foraging, are often assumed to have little effect on dispersal at larger scales (tens to thousands of kilometers). In this review, we (1) place foraging within the context of current knowledge on behaviors that influence dispersal and transport, (2) provide evidence for foraging behavior as a driving mechanism of distributions, and (3) present a meta-analysis of dispersal distances estimated for three dispersal hypotheses (passive, swimming directly against currents, and foraging behavior) from 59 studies that document oceanographic conditions and in situ organism distributions. Results of the analyses reveal that when foraging and aggregative behaviors are considered, dispersal distances for larvae and zooplankton could be hundreds of kilometers less than many current dispersal estimates. Reduced transport because of foraging implies that individual populations might be more isolated than currently accepted. These findings suggest that fine-scale organism behaviors should be considered in models aimed to improve conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {1 Body-size may be an important feature of the structure of food webs. Detailed food web data are however scarce, particularly those including ontogenetic dietary shifts within species. We examined the predator guild in a well characterized food web, that of Broadstone Stream (UK), to assess the importance of body-size within and among species in relation to intraguild predation and niche overlap. 2 In agreement with recent food web theory, mutual predation and cannibalism were frequent and occurred in many pairwise permutations. This intraguild predation was strongly asymmetric, being determined by relative body-size within and among species, and seasonal `ontogenetic reversals' in trophic status arose when generations overlapped. 3 Predator size determined dietary overlap, with ontogenetic shifts often outweighing taxonomic differences. Small predators had the narrowest diets, regardless of species, and were limited to feeding on a restricted subset of the total prey size-spectrum. Niche overlap decreased as pairwise differences in body-size increased among and within species. Overlap in diet also tracked seasonal changes in resource availability, being highest in summer, when prey were abundant and small, and declining progressively over time, as prey became scarcer and/or larger. The small predators also became more detritivorous as prey abundance declined and the larger prey species attained size-refugia. 4 The body-size constraints driving feeding relationships within the predator guild, in terms of both resource partitioning and intraguild predation, lend support to recent niche models of food web structure (Warren 1996; Williams \& Martinez 2000). The highly interconnected food web of Broadstone Stream appeared to be structured by relatively simple rules, with seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the size-spectrum accounting for most of the changes in predator diet and trophic position. Encounter rate in time (prey and predator mobility) and space (microhabitat use) and foraging mode also influenced prey vulnerability and niche overlap, but were secondary to the effect of body-size.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton plays a crucial role in the energy flow and nutrient cycling of aquatic ecosystems. To understand the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in the Wujiang River, Yungui Plateau, SW China, samples were collected in 12 locations in wet and dry seasons and analyzed. We hypothesized that phytoplankton assemblages would exhibit significant temporal variability, with niche breadths of dominant species fluctuating seasonally, leading to distinct patterns of species association and community stability. Results show differences in community structure between the two seasons, but such changes did not cause non-significant differences in {$\alpha$}-diversity. Diatoms were dominant in the assemblages in terms of biomass, while the numerical abundance of Cyanobacteria was highest in the wet season due to their relatively small cells. Rainfall-driven changes in runoff significantly altered nutrient availability, which in turn strongly affected phytoplankton structure. The more intense water flow contributed to a greater {$\beta$}-diversity in the wet season, driven primarily by species replacement, with stochastic processes played a more important role during the dry season. In the dry season, dominant species exhibited a broader niche breadth and greater niche overlap, along with more positive species associations, suggesting a more stable and resilient community structure. Conversely, in the wet season, species had narrower niche breadth and less niche overlap, leading to a less stable community. Both negative and positive species associations were observed, indicating a complex balance between environmental filtering and competition within the assemblages. These findings provide important insights into how seasonal environmental changes, particularly water flow and nutrient dynamics, shape phytoplankton communities in aquatic ecosystems. Understanding the mechanisms driving changes in community and stability is critical for predicting the impacts of climate change and managing aquatic biodiversity, as fluctuations in water flow and nutrient input may alter ecosystem functioning and productivity.},

  abstract = {Although metacommunity models generally formulate dispersal as a random, passive process, mounting evidence suggests that dispersal can be an active process depending on species fitness over the landscape, particularly in multitrophic communities. How different dispersal modes (i.e. from random to increasingly fitness-dependent dispersal) modulate the effect of dispersal on biodiversity remains unclear. Here, we used a metacommunity model of food webs to investigate the effects of dispersal and habitat heterogeneity on biodiversity and how these effects may be dependent on dispersal mode. Our results showed that compared to isolated systems, random dispersal increased local food web diversity ({$\alpha$} diversity) but decreased across-community dissimilarity ({$\beta$} diversity) and regional food web diversity ({$\gamma$} diversity), consistent with findings from competitive metacommunity models. However, fitness-dependency could alter the effects of dispersal on biodiversity. Both {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} diversity increased with the strength of fitness-dependency of dispersal, while {$\alpha$} diversity peaked at intermediate fitness-dependency. Notably, strong fitness-dependent dispersal maintained levels of {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} diversity similar to those observed in isolated systems. Thus, random dispersal and isolation (i.e. no dispersal) can be considered as two extremes along the continuum of fitness-dependent dispersal, in terms of their effects on biodiversity. Moreover, both biodiversity-habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity-habitat connectivity relationships depended on the dispersal mode. Strikingly, under random dispersal, {$\gamma$} diversity decreased with habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, but under strong fitness-dependent dispersal, it increased with habitat heterogeneity and remained unchanged as habitat connectivity increased. Our study highlights the context dependence of dispersal effects on biodiversity in heterogeneous landscapes. Our findings have useful implications for biodiversity conservation and landscape management, where management strategies should account for different modes of dispersal across taxa, thus different responses of biodiversity to habitat heterogeneity and connectivity.},

  abstract = {Understanding consumer--resource interactions is essential for understanding the trophic dynamics of species-rich fish communities. Woodland et al. (Oikos 125:556--565, 2016) assumed that trophic position (TP) distributions of primary consumers and tertiary species are restricted versus intermediate consumers tending to be omnivores with broader TP distribution, where these omnivores often dominate the overall biomass. With rare evidence supporting this hypothesis in a river, we tested it in the species-rich Pearl River fish assemblage, China. Using bulk stable isotope (SI) approach ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N), the TPs, SI distribution parameters, isotopic niche sizes (as standard ellipse areas, SEA) and interspecific niche overlap were calculated for the abundant fish species. Fishes of intermediate TPs (i.e. omnivores) had larger {$\delta$}13C variance/ range, broader isotopic niches and higher niche overlap compared to fishes at low TPs and high TPs, indicating a higher degree of trophic redundancy among the omnivores, whereas high TP fish had narrower niche and lower niche overlap, indicating trophic partitioning among tertiary species. These omnivores at intermediate TPs between 2.4 and 2.8 dominated fish biomass. The results not only support the Woodland et al. (Oikos 125:556--565, 2016) hypothesis in the river, but also provide a novel explaining in how niche sizes and overlap vary by TP.},

  abstract = {We have tested two hypotheses which may explain two different patterns which underlie coexistence in two species of desert gerbils (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum). The two patterns are temporal partitioning of foraging activity and shared preference habitat selection. When sympatric, G. pyramidum uses the early part of the night most heavily while G. allenbyi is most active in the late part of the night. Although both species prefer the same habitat type (semistabilized sand dune), in the presence of G. pyramidum, G. allenbyi utilizes mainly the secondary habitat type (stabilized sand dune). The hypotheses are 1) one species is dominant (G. pyramidum) while the other (G. allenbyi) is an energetically more efficient forager, and 2) one species has the ability to quickly harvest seeds in dense resource patches and the other species can harvest seeds profitable at lower resource densities. We tested the hypotheses in an experiment conducted in four enclosed plots. Two additional unfenced plots served as controls. Two of the enclosed plots contained mixed populations of both species while the other two fenced plots contained G. allenbyi only. In contrast to patterns of activity of G. allenbyi with G. pyramidum present, G. allenbyi is also very active early in the night even on the semistabilized dunes when G. pyramidum is absent. The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis that interference is the key factor to understanding the coexistence of the two species. Both the temporal and spatial patterns are the result of the dominant G. pyramidum species excluding the energetically efficient G. allenbyi from the preferred time of activity and habitat type.},

  abstract = {Accurate assessments of fish populations are often limited by re-observation or recapture events. Since the early 1990s, passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) have been used to understand the biology of many fish species. Until recently, PIT applications in small streams have been limited to physical recapture events. To maximize recapture probability, we constructed PIT antenna arrays in small streams to remotely detect individual fish. Experiences from two different laboratories (three case studies) allowed us to develop a unified approach to applying PIT technology for enhancing data assessments. Information on equipment, its installation, tag considerations, and array construction is provided. Theoretical and practical definitions are introduced to standardize metrics for assessing detection efficiency. We demonstrate how certain conditions (stream discharge, vibration, and ambient radio frequency noise) affect the detection efficiency and suggest that by monitoring these conditions, expectations of efficiency can be modified. We emphasize the importance of consistently estimating detection efficiency for fisheries applications.}

  abstract = {The rate of somatic growth determines when individuals transition between life stages, which along with survival and reproduction, are principal factors governing the rate of population change. For short-lived species that inhabit seasonally dynamic environments, accounting for fluctuations in somatic growth is necessary to make reliable inferences about population dynamics. We describe a Bayesian, state-space formulation of a von Bertalanffy growth model that integrates a sinusoidal model to allow for seasonal fluctuations in growth while also accounting for individual heterogeneity and measurement error. We use this model to describe post-metamorphic growth of canyon treefrogs, Hyla arenicolor, based on capture-recapture data from 404 individuals over a two-year period. For simulated data where we assumed growth varies seasonally, our model provides unbiased estimates of growth rate, mean asymptotic length, standard deviation of individual asymptotic lengths, and date of maximum growth. For field data from canyon treefrogs, we found strong evidence of seasonal variation in growth, with maximum growth during the summer monsoon season. Growth rate of females was 19 \% lower than males, although on average, females reached asymptotic lengths that were 15 \% greater than males. Ignoring systematic intra-annual variation in growth can bias inferences about population dynamics, particularly for fast-growing species that reproduce more than once per year or inhabit environments with strong seasonal signals. We present a straightforward approach for using repeated length measurements from individuals of unknown age to estimate growth while accounting for seasonality and individual heterogeneity, which are sources of variation common in many vertebrate populations.},
